The Cheddar tribe was off to a hot start, as this personality filled tribe dominated the first challenge. Darby contributed lots of points to the win while everyone else (with one exception of Typo) also did great work on the challenge. As far as social dynamics went, Darby was a central figure as he earned the highest trust ranking and ended up in the Four Suits alliance with Swiss, Connor, and Eck. Some individual conversation has also created a tight relationship between CCB and Typo, but being on the outs might not be a great combo for them in the future. Luckily for Typo, he is viewed very positively despite his lack of challenge performance (which was very understandable due to his new son, congrats again Typo!), netting him a P tone. He may also be able to take advantage of Connor and CCB being less trusted members of the tribe, despite Connor&#39;s inclusion in the current majority alliance. Unlike Typo, CCB was met with a more mixed reaction as his personality while generally enjoyed was also very strong and sometimes off putting to his tribemates, earning him an M tone. Ultimately CCB is enjoyed by his tribe, but being the big personality on the outs may lead to some trouble in the future should Cheddar go to tribal. As for Darby, Eck and Swiss, they were all shown to be strong players both physically in the challenge and strategically / socially in their alliance, netting them all CPs! Typo also earns a UTR for his lack of availability during the first cycle, but we hope to see that ramp up soon!

On the Mozzarella tribe we saw a much more quiet and laidback group compared to the others. However, early on they had an interesting moment when one of their tribemates, Melzcat was swapped out due to inactivity and replaced with Pichu soon after the challenge started! For the most part this team was also well balanced in their challenge performance with Ani, Penny and Pichu scoring a majority of the points! Mamo and Toon ultimately scored a fair share of points as well, leaving only one player in the dust in regards to points... Drew. In regards to social dynamics, it was pretty apparent that Penny and Ani were generally the most sociable getting along with pretty much everyone on the tribe. Mamrosity and Toon were slightly less active outside of the challenge but were still able to form bonds with most of their tribemates. Unfortunately for Pichu and Drew they quickly fell onto the outs. Pichu didn&#39;t have as much of a connection with his tribe for joining so late, but they did end up really respecting him for his challenge performance, earning him a P tone. Drew ended up being relatively inactive for the majority of the first cycle and many of his tribemates noticed, leaving him low on the trust rankings and netting him a UTR. The only major player to note was Ani who was showing some good strategic and social reads in their confessionals netting them a CP.

At Parmesan, the main theme of the episode was a clear lack of organization. They quickly fell behind in the challenge and stayed behind, although they made it seem like they might have caught up in the last minute. Unfortunately, they could not coordinate as a tribe as they missed many easy points in the challenge. However, this was in no part due to lack of effort from Shane or Lavender who both led the tribe in points scored. Holly, Sunder, and Sificon also managed to score a fair amount of points, but it was Carie who really caused the tribe to struggle. Outside the challenge, Shane and Lavender quickly formed a strong bond, also working well with Sificon and Sunder. They were able to form an alliance of four Parma-Pals for the vote they had, where Carie threw out Holly&#39;s name before disappearing into the night. The Parma-Pals decided that Carie throwing Holly under the bus was not a good vibe, and the terrible challenge performance was enough to get Carie sent home. For their excellent socialization and working well together, Shane, Lavender, and Sificon earn CPs while Sunder gets a MOR for being slightly less involved with the main alliance. Holly gets an UTRM for good contributions to the challenge but a slower social game. And Carie gets an OTTN for not doing much for the challenge and then immediately throwing Holly under the bus, which ultimately got her voted out.

Shane comes in the top spot for our first ever episode in Snackvivor! His heavy participation during the challenge alongside his ride-or-die relationship with Lavendar put him in a strong position out the gate. He was able to also befriend Sunder and Sificon and together they formed the Parmesan Pals alliance! This setup Shane to be in a good spot should they lose immunity with a strong connection to almost every player on the tribe as well as being seen as a valuable challenge member. 

Ani comes in a close second behind Shane for many similar reasons. They have already shown to have a strong understanding of the game, did fairly well in the challenge and was perceived relatively well by the rest of their tribe earning them the top spot on the trust rankings (alongside Penny). However, the Mozzarella tribe does seem to be a bit more laid back then Ani is, and that could either help position Ani into a leadership position or put a target on their backs. Only time will tell!

Darby comes in third for being seen as one of the strongest players on the Cheddar tribe! They carried the first challenge for their tribe, had a hand in creating the first alliance and is very sociable! They also reached the top trust ranking for their tribe (tied with Eck!). The only thing putting Darby slightly lower than Ani is that the Cheddar tribe seems to have a lot of strong players and any one of them could easily find themselves in control within an episode or two. 

Lavender ultimately rounds out the bottom of our contenders for episode one mostly due to their strong social presence and strong duo with Shane. They were only slightly behind Shane in the trust rankings and did slightly less in the first challenge, but in general Shane and Lavendar are both really strong players who seem to have a tight grip on their tribe. Lavender could easily climb up this list with each passing episode, let&#39;s see if it happens!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072695512203001956 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072695512203001956><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/07/2023 8:48 PM">20:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1072695511976517684/image.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1072695511976517684/image.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (69.28 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072695607715692654 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072695607715692654><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/07/2023 8:49 PM">20:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Cheddar 

The Cheddar Tribe is currently being lead by Darby and Eck in the trust deparment both have a 2.2 with 2 first places a piece. Swiss and Typo are not that far behind them so they should still be in good standings for the time being. CCB comes in fifth with several last place finishes besides a singular first place from Typo. Connor from some act of voodoo is in last place on this tribe despite being in one of the first alliances of the season. It would be intresting to see where the tribe heads if they were to go to a tribal.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072695732810829844 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072695732810829844><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/07/2023 8:49 PM">20:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1072695732571746344/image.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1072695732571746344/image.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (64.85 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072695813999956049 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072695813999956049><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/07/2023 8:50 PM">20:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Mozzarella

The Mozzarella tribe is the tale of two halves. Ani and Penny are both tied for first in trust rankings but Penny has 3 first places from other tribe mates and 2 fourth places. One of these fourth places comes from the person who is trusted the least so she is rocking it. Ani is a little more consitent at the top with good trust from everyone besides Mamo. Mamo an Toon are not that far behind Penny and Ani with a good trust ranking across the board. Pichu and Drew on the other hand are not in good standings with the tribe with being at the lowe part of the trust rankings from nearly everyone besides eachother.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072695878265086074 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072695878265086074><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/07/2023 8:50 PM">20:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1072695878084739232/image.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1072695878084739232/image.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (56.67 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072695976285978674 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072695976285978674><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/07/2023 8:50 PM">20:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Parmesan 

Congrats to Shane for having the best trust rankings in this first cycle! the only player to score below a 2 the entire game so far with a ton of first place finishes and just one third place from Sunder. Lavender and Sifi come close behind Shane with a score of 2 showing they should be in some good standings. Sunder comes in fourth with an okay trust ranking scoring a 3 or 4 from everyone. Holly and Carie come in last place with neither of them scoring above fourth place.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=star><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=⭐ src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/2b50.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=totopray><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=totopray src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1062127067577204827.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072696023350255656 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072696023350255656><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/07/2023 8:51 PM">20:51</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cheese is off to a great start for getting the season managed, but DID go a little crazy with the overwhelming vibes. This gives him an OTTPP. Sappho (me thats me) and Mai also were introducers of tribes, earning Mai a solid CP-- but Sappho did bring up Final Fantasy XIV multiple times this cycle, earning her an OTTN. Mai was met with mixed results from staff, having a clash with Sappho wherein he called her a &quot;wife guy&quot; and everyone else agreed, which I think warrants an M tag at least. Fish and Cnid were very helpful with the spec games, earning them both MORPs for positive views from the specs and production alike. Dino earns himself a UTRP for under the radar briefly convincing some peoople that he did, actually, get casted, and that was a little funny I guess. Platty said &quot;fruity goat balls&quot; a total of 8 times. INV. And Han was on vacation all week, OTTN. LAst but not least, we have the spectators, who asked a very powerful mix of really solid questions and very eye rolling ones! We&#39;ll give them a MORM this week.


For our contenders, Cheese starts out strong contender, as the season is named after him. Next up is Mai, showing really funny potential with cast announcements, and last is Sappho, with having a really weird fascination with discord server perm management.

Stay tuned next week for more!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cheddar took more of a backseat this episode after winning immunity once more. Darby, Eck and Typo were able to secure just enough points to secure Cheddar second place in the challenge, just narrowly beating out Mozzarella! After the challenge was over Typo was able to find the clue for an immunity idol and quickly shared that information with Eck and they began to work on the puzzle together, netting them both CPs for the episode. Swiss, Connor and CCB were relatively quiet this episode except for Connor’s attempt to make plans for who the next boot was in his alliance chat before the challenge was over, garnering mixed to negative reactions from his alliance members, netting him an N tone. Although CCB was not a part of any major moment during the episode as he sat out of the challenge and did not take part in any idol hunting or strategic discussions, he still was a very loud and vocal personality in tribe chat giving him yet another OTT. Connor ultimately earns a UTR for his overall lack of activity in the episode outside of his few comments in his alliance chat.


<strong>Mozzarella</strong> <img

After a very calm start to the game the Mozzarella tribe ended up having quite the crazy cycle. Although they put up a valiant effort they barely lost the challenge by a single point. With a Tribal Council on the horizon it seemed like they would come together for a simple vote against a seemingly inactive player with Drew. Although the vote seemed to have been solidified early on, things quickly derailed when Toon let Drew know people were coming for him. With this new information, Drew confronted Penny about voting for him, which let everyone else know that Toon had leaked the vote. This chain of events would lead to the formation of the “Sappho Fan Club” alliance consisting of Penny, Mamo, Pichu and Ani. The group quickly came together and agreed that the current vote had to be on Drew with Toon being next should they go to tribal again. The confrontation from Drew and leaking of the vote from Toon gives them both OTTN, while Ani and Mamo get a CP for leading the charge on the vote. Ani also earns an M tone for the tribe&#39;s mixed reception to their challenge-strong mantra. Penny also earns an M tone for some of the comments they made during their interaction with Drew, unintentionally confirming he was on the chopping block. Lastly, Pichu earns a CP for being a part of majority alliance but more importantly finding and solving the idol clue, earning him a temporary Hidden Immunity Idol.

Things simmered down a little bit during this cycle. The challenge was a bit of both a hit and a miss, swinging by with three solid wins and two hard losses. Holly remains UTR as her challenge score and lack of visibility keeps her from pulling forward, as well as being left out of the majority alliance <em>’parm pals’</em> - Which doesn’t spell good for her if they go back to tribal council. Lavender also had an unfortunate challenge performance, scoring zero points for the tribe. On the bright side, his discovery of the idol hunt and sharing that revelation with Shane really puts a spotlight on them. They valiantly worked on the clues and piecing everything together, earning the both of them a solid CP. Sificon drops off a little bit, having spent less time socializing with the others and giving up on the idol hunt after discovering it. Thankfully they managed to help clutch the win for the tribe, beating the second place puzzle out by ten whole minutes! Sunder also skirts around the edges of activity this cycle, as she crushed the challenge but didn’t interact much with her tribemates. The entire tribe was relatively relaxed this cycle, meaning none of them got over a 2 in terms of visibility - But solid bonding and idol hunting went down regardless!

He has high trust from all of his tribe mates and is seen in a mostly positive light from all of them. Shane has shown to have an understanding of the game and along with his connections he should be in a comfortable spot for the foreseeable future and we can see him being able to work with any conditions that may arise. 

<strong>Darby</strong> has moved up to second place from the tribe, continuing to view them in a positive light. Almost everyone on the tribe loves Darby and wants to work with them. They have shown to have multiple traits needed to succeed in this game with their good social game, strategic mind and challenge prowess. They have a good read on the dynamics of the tribe and are already looking towards the future of the game and what is best for their game.

<strong>Mamo</strong> joins the contenders this episode for being the center point of the tribe and being one of the few people on the tribe to receive no backlash during this cycle. Multiple people came to Mamo wanting to work with him and start an alliance with him and while multiple other people were seen in a negative light for how they are playing he was seen as a valuable potential ally by all. He has a lot of potential paths to go and he should be able to move wherever he wants. 

<strong>Lavender</strong> rounds out contenders again from their strong social presence. Multiple people think Lavender is their number one and was a center point of the challenge hunt on their tribe with Sifi telling Lavender about the hunt and actually working on the hunt with Shane. People want to work with Lavender and there is no reason to think that people in the future will want Lavender as their ally.

Cheese said he &quot;didn&#39;t need to proof read anything&quot; and then immediately Fish found typos in everything he had written. Sappho said he was wrong about something that happened in some stupid ORG they played together in and he got receipts and actually he was right but like. Whatever. that doesn&#39;t matter anyway. And Han purchased 101 dalmations so they could turn them into a very unique fur coat. Fish&#39;s altercations with Sappho and Cheese earned him a CPM, while reviled by his fellow production members, he remains well beloved by the castaways for his challenge, which was overall well received. Mai did a good job at playing the middle road between production members by fanning the flames on ALL sides because he just wants to watch the world burn. This earns him a perfect MOR. Dino was great with helping with the spectators because he just GETS them you know. He just RELATES on a personal level. And that&#39;s why he&#39;s decided to not read any of the documents we have about any of the challenges; to connect to them better <img

The specs have been getting ROUDY with their reactions, which are both fun and eye opening to the production cast. They did have to be reminded to not flirt with the castaways however, earning them an N tone.

Sappho falls off contenders this week because she realized that she doesn&#39;t have any challenges coming up for a while. LOL. So taking her place is FISH!!!!

Once again, Cheddar absolutely destroys the challenge. It wasn’t a runaway this time, but they were ahead of the others and certainly pulled through strongly! A large portion of this can be contributed to Darby’s artistic talent and Typo’s graphic design chops, which would <em>usually</em> earn them more of a positive tone for the episode. Despite the two of them (and Eck) tying for first place in terms of trust rankings, it seems as though a rift has been created by the idol hunt. Darby solved the hunt correctly, only to find that the advantage was already taken - He then immediately jumped on the assumption that Typo already found it and was sending them on a wild goose chase. His reaction in his confessionals and in his one on one with Eck earns him his first OTTN. Typo, on the other hand, continued to thrive through his strategic thinking and social gaming despite the lack of tribals (and potentially new enemy) which earned him a CP. CCB also pulled through with a CP, and I am incredibly proud of him for continuing to grow throughout the season! This includes his game awareness improving, as he was the first person to pin Eck/Darby for potentially being a duo due to their habit of constantly hopping on the tribe voice chat together… Just the two of them. Eck continued to skirt by with MOR, keeping up the social game while not involving himself in any of the drama happening with the <em>Puzzle Gang</em>. Unfortunately, Swiss was a little unheard of in this cycle with such little activity - And Connor remains UTR as his fellow alliance members prepared themselves to throw him under the bus come their first tribal, and they even considered throwing the challenge to be able to do so. 

<strong>Mozzarella</strong> <img

After a unanimous vote on Drew it looked like the writing was on the wall for Mozzarella. Should they go back to tribal it would likely be Toon going home due to his leaky behavior and overall messy gameplay at the previous vote. Unfortunately for Toon, Mozzarella was unable to secure enough points in the “Eat the Menu” challenge, barely losing once again, sending them back to tribal once more. The “Sappho Fan Club” alliance quickly agreed that Toon would be the target and began to ice him out, an efficient strategy, but an obvious one. Ultimately, Toon does go home in a 4-0 vote after Pichu played his idol which was expiring. Penny, Mamo and Pichu earn CPs for discussions in regards to the vote, the future, and for their challenge performance. Pichu also earns a P tone for garnering much praise from his tribemates in regards to the art for the menu! Toon earns an N tone for the overall distrust the tribe had for him after the Drew vote and his failed attempts to save himself only further cementing him as the vote.

<strong>Parmesan</strong> <img

The highlight of Parmesan this round was quite frankly nothing. The Parmesan tribe put in a great effort for the challenge, but it was not enough as they finished last. It appeared that Lavender and Holly contributed the most to the Parmesan menu and this earned Holly a MORP. However, Shane did not end up making major contributions and had quite a few complaints about the results which lands him a CPN. At the onset of tribal, it was clear that the Parma-pals were sticking together and Holly would be the vote. Shane and Lavender ended up in an alliance with Holly just to make sure the vote wasn&#39;t on them in case of any Tribal Council craziness, but things went smoothly as Holly was vote out unanimously, which is why Sunder, Sificon, and Lavender all earn a MOR.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=totopray><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=totopray src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1062127067577204827.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1074221339742838794 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1074221339742838794><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/12/2023 1:52 AM">01:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

Unfortunately <strong>Shane’s</strong> social gaming has seriously dropped, and his negativity/lack of assistance during the creative challenge does not go unnoticed. Especially with Lavender seemingly letting go of the idea of him being his number one ally. <strong>Darby</strong> also drops off the list, despite his challenge performance, for a slight lack of game awareness surrounding his relationships with Eck and Typo - As well as the recent habit to jump to conclusions about his fellow tribemates. We’ll chalk this up to going a bit stir crazy on Cheddar with the lack of tribals. 

<strong>Mamo</strong> and <strong>Lavender</strong> stocks shoot through the roof! Mamrosity climbs to the top of contenders, which I’m sure quite a few of you are very happy about - As am I! His recent positioning has been incredibly good, as well as his social gaming. His game awareness regarding the future is incredibly insightful and he provides lots of perception into his thought process and how he knows he can be successful. Lavender also moves up a lot higher, if we were doing power rankings right now there’d be no way he wouldn’t be at the top in my opinion. He’s tied for the highest trust ranking level in the entire game, he’s forward thinking and conscientious, he contributed a huge portion of the challenge <em>and</em> he’s completely in control. There’s no doubt that if he wanted Holly in and someone else out, he would’ve worked with Shane and made it happen - Instead, he steered Shane away from that and kept trudging forward. Mad respect.  

Aaaaaaaaaaand… We have two new challengers approaching the contenders arena! Woot woot! 

<strong>Penny</strong> takes the third slot after working her butt off and earning it. She’s the one who’s tied with Lavender for highest trust ranking level and her positioning only gets better as time goes on. She always pushes for more from her fellow tribemates, encouraging activity and dynamic thinking from her allies - She’s incredibly ambitious and knows what she wants, and she’s going to get it. <strong>Typo</strong> brings up the rear, ironically closing out our contenders and taking the spot Darby would’ve fallen into. He is quickly becoming quite the star now that he’s more active around camp, helping carry challenges and boosting his social gaming. His own cognizance of the game isn’t clouded by assumptions, despite potential distrust he may have for others, and he’s incredibly well positioned for someone who is not only outside the main alliance on his tribe, but also for someone who literally just had a baby.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02/12/2023 1:52 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1074221568185606265 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1074221568185606265><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/12/2023 1:52 AM">01:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

With such quotes as &quot;I will be homophobic if I have to&quot; targetting 3/4ths of the prod staff, and also accidentally locking all of the channels before swap, that earns him a DOUBLE NEG tone which is honestly impressive. The Dino/Fish/Sappho alliance continues  to hold strong, while both Sappho (me that&#39;s me) and Fish were lambasted by Cheese&#39;s onslaught, Dino managed to escape his tyrranical ire while also maintaining a great relationship in his alliance, earning him a UTRPP once again. Fish&#39;s tattling repeatedly on Cheese while also maintaining his alliance earns him an OTTM, and Sappho managed to ACCIDENTALLY FORGET EXPLAINING CNID&#39;S CPN IN LAST WEEK&#39;S EDGIC earning her a solid OTTN. Cnid took the slight in stride, and also managed to make everyone laugh with their witty swap bullshit, earning them a CPP. Mai once again has been playing the middle man on everyone, AND HOSTED THE CHALLENGE THIS WEEK earning him an OTTM. Platty did not say fruity goat balls once. INV1. Unfortunately, Han managed to trick Hercules into losing strength for a day while they decided to overthrow Mt. Olympus earning them an unfortunate OTTN. Bui REDEEMED himself this week with kissing Sappho&#39;s ass which she really likes and Ian is a literal perfect human being, so they get their CPP collectively. Hungry specs decided to get spicy this cycle and started REALLY fucking up misgendering prod so they get a CPNN. Also they decided they wanted an OTTN and im not giving them that.

For our contenders, while Fish is in good standings in his alliance, the onslaught by cheese has dropped him off contenders. Mai raises up a step, because his challenge was MOSTLY well received (imagine parm being even more sore of losers than they were lol) and cheese is homophobic. Han climbs their way onto the rankings after CONQUERING THEIR FEARS and making an alliance chat. We are SO proud. We&#39;ll see if this trend continues!</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02/12/2023 2:02 AM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=mewheart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=mewheart src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1019143669175033857.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

After a swap the newly formed Brie tribe quickly found themselves in hot water after losing the first immunity challenge. The cheddar tribe had a clear majority of four against the mozzarella and parmesan tribes with two members and one member respectively. The cheddars spent no time in forming an original cheddar alliance aptly named “old-cheddar-cheese” where they debated between targeting Ani, Sunder or Pichu. Ultimately Ani was able to form a bond with Eck which kept them off the chopping block and when deciding between Sunder or Pichu the group had felt that Sunder was more active and that they could work with her in the future. Pichu was able to figure out that he was the target and tried to fight to save himself, but unfortunately it was too little too late as the majority had set their sights on him and felt more comfortable with keeping Sunder and Ani. It was a relatively low-key vote for the most part until tribal council where Eck jokingly stated that he hoped his multiple alliances didn’t stab him in the back. Although it was a joke, multiple tribemates were put off by that notion and felt that Eck was a bit too volatile for their liking, earning him an OTT and an N tone. CCB, Swiss and Typo all earn CPs for their discussions involving which player was the right one to target for the vote and for reaching out to Sunder and Ani to ensure the vote was unanimous. CCB however continues to make odd off-hand unfiltered comments earning mixed reactions from his tribemates netting him an M tone. Ani earns a CP for their talks with Eck and the rest of their tribemates successfully avoiding being targeted for the first vote. Lastly, Pichu earns a CP for their attempts to save themselves but also an M tone for their failure to do so as his tribemates viewed him as inactive.

This swap certainly created some interesting dynamics here on Cotja, and they’ll lead to some amusing results when they eventually hit tribal - <em>Or</em> when they hit merge, whatever comes first. Connor and Darby (one half of the <em>Four Suits</em> alliance) get swapped almost entirely away from their starting tribe, and while Connor thinks that will provide him stability, Darby is ready to throw him under the bus at any point in time to solidify his own standing. While they’ve made a connection with Sificon, neither made enough of a lasting social impact to break up a potential Mozz/Parm teamup. Connor earns an N tone along with his MOR for being at the bottom of the tribe without being too overtly aware of it. Darby also gets MOR this episode (with higher visibility) because even though he’s strong socially and his other tribemates enjoy his company, he’s not exactly putting in a huge amount of work to claw his way out of his position. Speaking of Sificon, he is one of the few players on Cotija that nets a CP this episode! He is at the top right now, being in that alliance with Connor/Darby, as well as the remaining Parma Pals. His trust rankings are the best out of any other player, save for Typo’s whopping 1.8 average, and his positioning ensures he will have a ton of movability. Lavender is our other CP this episode, as his continual social strengths and challenge prowess proves to be incredibly useful. Lavender’s positioning will also lead to good things, with many players thinking that he is closer to him than he actually is - Including Shane. The Parma Pals are sticking close, but Shane seems to be falling behind steadily. His number one doesn’t exactly see him the same way anymore, and his challenge negativity/failure to connect with other players might come back to bite him later. Mamrosity and Penny both net themselves MOR3 this cycle, for being incredibly forward thinking and having a large open dialogue about their potential futures… They don’t have much to do <em>right now</em>, they’re content to sit back and let things play out a bit before snipping one of the Cheddar Hydra’s heads off.

<em>New challenger approaching yet again!</em>

<strong>Sificon</strong> <em>shoots</em> up to the top of contenders! He is doing amazing right now, swapping into a great position with his original Parma Pals and being able to keep that connection going, as well as being able to foster brand new relationships with the Cheddars and Mozzs! His game will have tons of flexibility in the future, and we’re very excited to see what he does with this newfound maneuverability. But with every <em>new</em> contender… Space has to be made for them. <strong>Penny</strong> drops off the list this cycle, while <strong>Mamo</strong> clings on to the bottom, as both of them are still just hanging around Cotija waiting for their moment to strike. Mamo barely pulls ahead as the rest of the tribe puts him above in Trust Rankings, including Penny herself!

<strong>Lavender</strong> also stays on the list, as his game awareness continues to sprout and grow larger! Keeping Shane super close, while opening dialogue with Sificon about cutting him later, putting out great vibes with the newcomers in the swap… It’s a balancing game and Lavender is killing it. Unfortunately, not much was going on at Cotja this cycle - Which lets <strong>Typo</strong> pull ahead. People are catching Typo <em>fever</em> left and right!! Everyone really likes him, even the people who didn’t include him in their alliance on Cheddar, and he has the best Trust Rankings in the game right now. He’s been included in every single alliance made on Brie so far! People also aren’t expecting him to be ready and willing to pull any moves on them or betray their trust, but his confessionals prove his strategy goes beyond that.

<em>Say hello to Sifi!</em> He has made major ups in regards to trust ranking, climbing all the way to first place on this new tribe and making connections to new people while continuing to develop relations with old tribemates. Lavender is right behind Sifi with the only downfall being a <em>single</em> last place ranking and scoring well with everyone else. Mamo and Penny are right in the middle having very similar trust rankings as eachother, and both having a wide range of placements with both scoring anywhere from 6-1. Darby comes up next being right in the middle, not having many big gains or big losses. Shane sadly continues to fall a bit being second to last on this tribe with the only real connections on the tribe being the people he was tribe with before.

Welcome to the Brie tribe~ Things already have shifted a lot in the trust department. In first place among <em>any</em> player this cycle is Typo! Typo is the only player with a trust ranking below 2 getting first place from all his former cheddar members and scoring well from the people he just met as well. Right behind Typo is Swiss, who is not that far behind him - Scoring mostly 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s. Ani has climbed up the ranks reaching third place on this tribe improving their postion which was falling a bit on the previous tribe. CCB and ECK both tie after this having a middling trust rankings but both of these players trust have been a little volatile as of late. Lastly, is Sunder and Pichu with Pichu scoring a tad bit higher with some first and second placements while Sunder has the worst trust ranking of the cycle despite seeming to have people that may want to work with them.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02/15/2023 3:57 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1075344211945209936 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1075344211945209936><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/15/2023 4:13 AM">04:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1075344256442585120 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1075344256442585120><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/15/2023 4:14 AM">04:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

There’s no other way to say it - Brie was a shit show this episode. The challenge immediately kicked off to a poor start when Ani, Eck, Swiss began to bicker about the challenge, accidentally triggering A2 a handful of times without understanding the rules. Eventually they were able to get themselves collected and were able to finish the challenge with less forbidden word triggers than Cotija by 1! Well, that was until CCB decided to say a phrase containing enough forbidden words right before the challenge ended causing them to lose the challenge and go to tribal once more. Eck was blamed at first for the challenge loss due to early bickering, but he was able to figure out that had CCB not said anything at the end of the challenge they would have won. 

Eck decided to start a charge against CCB, including telling everyone that CCB had an idol. What Eck neglected to mention was that he had found the idol earlier in the episode and gave it to CCB. Swiss approached CCB about having the idol, causing distrust between the two and making CCB realize that Eck had leaked the idol to the rest of the tribe. Typo, Swiss, Sunder and Ani realizing that Eck and CCB were becoming too volatile and fearing the idol decided to split their votes two on Eck and two on CCB so that in case an idol was played they would still be able to keep themselves safe on a revote. With Eck and CCB refusing to work with each other and the majority leaving them out of their plans it seemed the vote was trending towards a 2-2-1-1. However, at tribal council CCB announced his idol publicly, calling Eck out for leaking the idol, how Eck found it originally, that he would play it on himself or Typo and then picked a fight with Swiss. Ultimately, CCB played the idol on himself, negating the two votes he received, causing Eck to go home in a 2-1-1 vote. 

CCB, Eck and Swiss all earn an OTT for their various outbursts at different points throughout the episode. CCB and Eck earn an N tone for blowing up their spots and losing the trust of their tribemates. Swiss get’s an M tone for properly playing around Eck and CCB’s chaos but still creating some chaos of their own at tribal council. Typo and Ani earn CPs for also taking part in the plan to flush the idol and take out Eck or CCB, but without playing into the chaos. Typo earns an M tone for being name dropped by CCB at tribal in regards to who he would play the idol for, causing some tribemates to question Typo’s closeness with CCB. Sunder was having fun being a background character once again as the world burned around them!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1076409132602634340 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1076409132602634340><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/18/2023 2:45 AM">02:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

This tribe was a little bit less hectic, so… Yay? Let’s do a tiny overview of this tribe’s much less tedious cycle! Darby, Mamrosity, Lavender and Sificon all score CPs this episode. Darby pulls himself up by his bootstraps a bit and starts social gaming his way through the tribe, fully informing both Lavender and Mamrosity that he is adamantly against sticking to original tribal lines, and it seems to be working! Connor/Sificon/Darby officially invited in Mamrosity - After a short while of Darby carefully trying to balance Mamrosity’s comfort levels and his own future goals, Connor swoops in and straight up pulls him in with little to no push and pull. Connor’s larger dedication to activity in this episode earns him a higher visibility, but the weird balance of attempting to set up connections while not successfully changing anyone’s thoughts on his position within the tribe keeps him with MOR. Penny and Shane also keep the MOR train going! Penny continues to be slightly distant due to her sickness, it’s very reasonable but does continue to affect her middle man position. Sificon remains to be one of the players with the best flexibility going forward, especially with merge on the horizon and so many options in his back pocket. 

<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Typo</strong> stocks drop considerably after Brie’s last tribal. He continues to be a frontrunner in terms of strategy, taking part in the plan to flush the idol, but that name-drop by CCB might seriously affect his game in the future. Now that merge is approaching sometime soon, his threat level could rise considerably if people assume that he’s much more socially connected than they knew him to be - So CCB potentially tanked one of his largest ally’s entire game. <strong>Ani</strong> also joins us, once again making the contenders list! All of the drama on Brie let them rise in the backlines, taking advantage of the new positioning! Their unfortunate drop off contenders was barely a fault of their own before, but now that they can skirt around the edges of the tribe and use these mishaps as leverage? They&#39;re back in business baby!

<strong>Mamrosity</strong> and <strong>Lavender</strong> rise up slightly! They are both incredibly deep thinkers and know exactly who they’re close to and who they want to take further. Their game awareness is consistently impressive, and it’s super interesting to see what their perspective on the game looks like and how they use that to maneuver their social situations. <strong>Sificon</strong> remains at the tip top! His options are wide open for the upcoming merge, and that movability is going to come in handy when swap/original tribes lines start melding together.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1076409196574150716 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1076409196574150716><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/18/2023 2:45 AM">02:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

After an incredibly close challenge where multiple players on both sides failed to follow the rules, Cotija loses the tie-breaker sending them to their only tribal of the swap phase. Unfortunately for Darby and Connor, there was a strong anti-Cheddar sentiment coming into the tribal due to Cheddar having the most remaining members and the expectation of a merge on the horizon. The alliance of Penny, Shane, Sificon, Lavender and Mamo (known as Parmarella) debated which to target, ultimately leaning towards Connor after some individual conversations with Darby, feeling Darby was more likely to work with them in the future. The vote seemed like a simple 6-1 on Connor, but Shane, fearing an idol (That just so happens to be in Darby’s pocket) threw a vote on Darby just in case, leaving the vote 5-1-1 and sending Connor home. Darby earns a CP for being able to analyze his position and work his way into the majority. Lavender, Mamo and Sificon also net CPs for their strategic discussions, 1-on-1s with Darby and prep for the merge. Shane’s decision to throw a vote on Darby to protect himself but not telling his allies about it is met with mixed reactions, netting him a M tone. Connor earn’s an N tone for his general negative perception from his tribemates and for his final words attempting to throw some other players under the bus.

Things are a little bit more chill here on Brie! Thank goodness - Cause there was quite a bit of drama last cycle, eh? We start off with a bit of an apology tour from CCB, his attempt at damage control is relatively tame for his usual antics - But CCB <em>is</em> CCB, so of course it’s just a smidgen over the top! Sunder is the only one who really takes a step back this cycle, finally free from the confines of a swap tribal and landing her another UTR. Typo also takes a step back, enjoying the voteless cycle and spending some time away. Ani and Swiss net a higher visibility MOR role for this episode, remaining relatively chillax but continuing to stay super active around camp! Not lots of game talk, but there was enough socializing to put a real impact on their relationships. No alliances were made, no one was freakin’ out… Just some disaster assessment and realignment.

<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>
<strong>Sificon</strong> and <strong>Lavender</strong> remain at the top! Not much changes there, both of them sitting pretty with their tight inner Parmesan alliance and the new Parmerella group - They’ll be going into merge with numbers, being relatively liked by everyone they’ve met so far, and also not having their names on the chopping block. They’re definitely at the top, and have lots of control. Unfortunately, the longer you have that much control, the easier it’ll be someone to put a target on you for it. We’ll see how long it lasts.

<strong>Ani</strong> falls behind, but not because their stocks drop - <strong>Darby’s</strong> stocks just rise up much further than before. He’s heading into a merge as a free agent, ready to bury the rest of Cheddar over six feet under. That might come back to bite him later, but for now it’s really working in his favor. He managed to get on every single player’s good side while not being included in any of their super secret alliances. His flexibility and maneuverability give him tons of options for the future. <strong>Mamo</strong> is kind of the best of both worlds. He’s playing a great middle game between being at the top of the remaining Mozzarella tribe and extending olive branches to the rest of the players.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1077479956780695573 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1077479956780695573><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/21/2023 1:40 AM">01:40</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1077480002037219359 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1077480002037219359><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/21/2023 1:40 AM">01:40</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Brie Tribe</strong>
<strong> </strong>
The Brie tribe is essentially split into two groups. First are is Swiss Typo Ani and Sunder who are doing well in the trust department. Then group CCB who is not. All of Swiss Typo Sunder and Ani have relatively good scores all being relatively the same as eachother with Type and Swiss being slightly ahead of Sunder and Ani but not my much. All of them are rating eachother in the 1-3 range. The lone exception on this tribe is CCB who received last in trust from everyone else on the tribe. If this tribe was to go to another tribal CCB would surely be the easiest vote (please ignore we are at merge at the time of posting this)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1077724419306299392 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1077724419306299392><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/21/2023 5:52 PM">17:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1077724419113353357/image.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1077724419113353357/image.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (107.98 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1077724565528137738 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1077724565528137738><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/21/2023 5:52 PM">17:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>Cotija Tribe</strong>
<strong> </strong>
The Cotija tribes trust ranking on the other hand are a bit more split following a bell curve. In first by far is Sificon who is almost 2 points ahead of second place with a ton of first place finishes and only one placement below second place (a third place at that) which is very impressive! Lavender and Mamo are next on the list being rated similarly. The only thing holding them back is being rated poorly from the player with the worst trust ranking on the tribe showing they are in good standings with who they need to be rated well with. Penny and Darby both stand in the middle meaning they are good for the time being. Lastly is Shane and Connor who both scored pretty poorly around the board besides one 2nd place finish from Lavender for Shane. Connor does not have that grace being scored last by almost everyone giving him the worst trust ranking of the cycle and again if this tribe were to go to tribal he would almost assuredly be the one voted out (please ignore once again that this is being posted after merge)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Gouda</strong>
Gouda’y everyone and welcome to the merge! Although everyone seemed to be getting along quite well at first, lines appeared to be quickly drawn in the sand with the original Parmesan and Mozzarella tribe members retaining their anti-Cheddar stance. Before the challenge was even announced many players had set their sights on CCB as the target since he was considered to be too much of a wildcard to leave around. Heading into the challenge it seemed like CCB would need immunity or a miracle to save himself, but unfortunately for him Sunder was the one to walk away with the immunity necklace and a spicy date with Brie! 

As mentioned previously, the Cheddars seem to be in the trickiest spot coming into the merge. Knowing he was on the chopping block, CCB pleaded with Darby to help turn the public perception of him around and to find a new target. While Darby did give a valiant effort in trying to save CCB, it was too little too late. However, Darby was able to work his way into some groupings and find his footing, which is more than what can be said about the rest of the Cheddars - namely Swiss and Typo. While Swiss and Typo weren’t the immediate targets, they still ended up in a troubling position as they were clearly on the bottom and weren’t putting in enough effort to build bonds and potentially change their perceptions. 

As for the Mozzarellas, Penny, Ani and Mamo were all able to regroup and form a larger majority with the Parmesans giving them some immediate security, but if they don’t break away from Parmesan soon they may find themselves outnumbered. Mamo and Penny seem to be in a slightly better position than Ani due to their tighter bonds with the Parmesans, but they all put in solid effort getting to know and bond with their fellow tribemates. 

The Parmesans seem to be in the best spot coming into the merge, namely Sificon and Lavender. Even though they have the same amount of members as the Cheddar tribe, their swap connections with the Mozzarellas seem to have paid off as they have the numbers to take control of the merge, and if they play their cards right they can outnumber the Mozzarellas as well. Sificon and Lavender seem to be at the head of the Parmarella alliance and are also the top two trusted players coming into the merge. As for Shane and Sunder, they are both in a good spot coming into the merge in regards to being in the majority, but their trust rankings and bonds with others leave something to be desired. While the Parmesans do seem to be on top right now, it is still very early in the game and a single conversation at the right time could change everything.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1078775366929350777 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1078775366929350777><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/24/2023 3:28 PM">15:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
Darby earns a CP for their strong strategic and social moments with the rest of their tribe and for building bonds with the Parmesan and Mozzarella members when their fellow Cheddars could not. They also earn a P tone for their noble effort to save CCB, even if it failed in the end. Lavender, Mamo and Sificon earn CP tones for their continued strong strategic and social gameplay, their ability to quickly and efficiently rope in their old tribemates into a large majority and their solid planning for the future. Sificon earns a P tone as well for their excellent social gameplay, being heavily respected and trusted by a majority of their tribemates! Typo earns a M tone this episode for being considered a good and friendly player by many, but also for being associated with some strong anti-Cheddar and anti-CCB sentiment. Unfortunately, his lack of availability coming into the merge may have set him off on the wrong foot with some folks, but he may be able to bounce back. Penny earns an OTT this episode for a very strong and vocal anti-CCB pitch that a lot of her tribemates found to be excessive and caused some of them to focus on her for a potential vote sooner than later. Penny also gets an N tone as many of her comments tribemates found to be too critical and a bit off putting. Lastly, CCB earns an OTT for his mad scramble to save himself, for making multiple last minute alliances and dropping them immediately and for many of his comments. He gets an M tone for his attempt to save himself and work with anyone, but also for his failure to make strong bonds with his tribemates and some of his comments that left a bad taste in some player’s mouths.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1078775521174896731 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1078775521174896731><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/24/2023 3:28 PM">15:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Sificon</strong> for the fourth episode in a row finds himself on top! He is extremely well liked and trusted by a majority of his tribemates, in a strong spot with his alliance, and so far hasn’t built much of a threat level despite his clear control of the game. It is still early in the merge however, and with great power comes great targetability. Sificon does seem to be a strong enough player to dodge a couple shots, but if he is not careful one could be fatal.

<strong>Mamo</strong> rises up to 2nd place after a very strong showing coming into the merge. While not in as strong a spot as Sificon, Mamo has also built a lot of strong relationships and is currently one of the most trusted players. While the Parmesans do seem to have a good grip on the game right now, Mamo is playing a very smart, safe and strategic game and is in a great position to make a move in a vote or two and flip the entire game on its head. While Mamo may not be on top right now, he does seem to be in the best spot to take a shot at Sificon, take the reins and barrel towards FTC. 

<strong>Lavender</strong> falls to the 3rd spot this episode solely due to the fantastic positioning and perception of the Sificon and Mamo. While Lavender is ever so slightly more trusted than Mamo, they have taken a bit of a backseat role to Sificon which can be good for the short-term in keeping their threat level down, but if they are not careful they may find themselves in a position where it’s too late to make the move that could win them the game.

<strong>Darby</strong> once again snags the 4th spot on the contenders list! Darby has ended up in a very unique position this game as a potential swing vote. He has put in a lot of effort to build bonds between all of his tribemates netting him a solid trust ranking and a safe spot in a few alliances. While Darby may not be on the top of any totem pole, he is certainly a smart enough player to know when to jump ship, and with a bit of luck (and an idol) on his side, he could definitely find a path to FTC with a very unique and possibly winning story. Only time will tell if he will succeed…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1078775618520481883 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1078775618520481883><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/24/2023 3:29 PM">15:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span>  <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1078775681900617831 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1078775681900617831><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/24/2023 3:29 PM">15:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

Continuing his dominance of late, Sificon comes in 1st for trust rankings once again and laps the competition with a score that&#39;s 2 points higher than second place. 

The next 3 spots are all extremely close to each other with Lavender, Mamo, and Darby all scoring within 0.2 of each other. The biggest thing to note among these three is just that Lavender is the only other player with multiple first place finishes while Darby and Mamo are just a little more consistent in the upper middle range. 

Next up right in the middle is Penny and Sunder. Penny scores a little higher mostly due to getting a first place vote but shoutout to Sunder who has slowly been crawling from being at the bottom of trust rankings since the start of the game into a respectable position. 

Ani is next with a trust ranking just slightly worse then Penny and Sunder, but is mostly untrusted. 

Near the end is the bunch of Shane, Swiss, and Typo who all have faced a similar fate this game where their trust has just gone down compared to earlier in the game. Each of these players are going to have to put in serious work to climb back into the game. 

Lastly is CCB who may or may not exist, scoring bottom two from almost everyone in the game and just way behind everyone else in the game. CCB would have needed something magical to happen at that point to save himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Gouda</strong>
After a relatively straightforward boot, this cycle was anything but. There were two challenges this episode, an auction where players could bid to earn fun items and a regular immunity challenge based around touchy subjects called sheep game. While the touchy subject&#39;s variant was anything but touchy, the auction had the complete opposite effect. The players quickly fell into bidding wars on multiple items causing a handful to go to a random draw leaving those who didn’t net any items feeling a bit scorned. From this, Darby earned an extra vote, Lavender earned a silly advantage, Penny earned $5 USD, Mamo earned a vote randomizer against them that tribal, Sunder earned a clue to the immunity idol hunt and Typo earned an advantage in the F10 challenge. However, it wasn’t until the secret extra tray for love letters that things got really spicy. All of the players agreed to bid low so that everyone could get a letter. Well, all but one player that is. Swiss immediately jumped the bet up to 500 making multiple players ineligible for the reward. This outraged Penny who called out Swiss publicly and privately for their actions. A few players decided to pool their remaining credits together to outbid Swiss, earning only Penny, Shane and Ani love letters. Lavender’s advantage was to force another player to only speak in emojis for the next 24 hours, immediately applying it to Swiss after the love letter fiasco. Many players were upset with Swiss’s behavior and felt that they should be the next one to go should they not win immunity. 

Unfortunately for Swiss, Sificon was able to snag immunity, even though Typo had an advantage, leaving Swiss in a very vulnerable position. While the initial target was on Swiss, a few players began to worry about their positions in the game and some of the advantages that had been earned during the auction. Most notably, Sunder had gotten a secret tray item that many thought could be an idol or idol clue, and they were also worried about Sunder’s position in the game as many were not sure where his alliances stood. Eventually this worry spread amongst many players and a group came together with a plan, target Sunder this round to possibly eliminate any advantage he may have earned, while also in some cases lowering their threat levels as one of their allies went home. However, for this plan to work a couple of names were floated around, namely Shane and Swiss. Ultimately this would create a very chaotic vote of 5 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 with Sunder being sent home. Two votes were on Shane, one vote on Mamo, one vote on Swiss and a randomized vote from Mamo on Penny.

Darby, Sificon and Mamo earn CPs this episode for their strategic discussions and for helping push the Sunder vote when most players were initially targeting Swiss. Mamo earns an M tone this episode for being seen as a bit too pushy by some and for their randomized vote punishment which he chose to share with many of his tribemates, having a relatively mixed reception. Typo earns a CP this episode as well for trying to find ways to better his own position, support Swiss if possible and for finding (and keeping quiet about) the immunity idol! Shane and Sunder both get M tones this episode for being heavily discussed as potential targets over Swiss who was publicly lambasted after the auction with many players finding them loyal and kind, but ultimately numbers they should cut sooner rather than later as it would ultimately lower their respective threat levels (on the grounds of losing an ally) by doing so. Penny and Swiss both earn OTT and N tones this episode, Swiss for their actions during the auction and afterwards, and Penny for her public fights with Swiss and the trash talking done behind the scenes that many players received negatively.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02/27/2023 11:30 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1079984105514619001 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1079984105514619001><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/27/2023 11:31 PM">23:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS</strong></em>

<strong>Sificon</strong> retains their number one contender position once again this episode for a continuously strong strategic, social and physical game. Sifi was able to not only secure immunity this episode but also used their social and strategic influence to flip the vote off of Swiss and onto Sunder. They have an incredibly strong game so far, and while some players have begun to notice, they still seemed to be well positioned enough to dodge a vote or two, but if they don’t start going a bit lower profile soon they may find themselves on the chopping block sooner than later.

<strong>Darby</strong> shoots up to the second contender spot this episode after a particularly strong social and strategic showing. They were able to join in on the vote to target Sunder further strengthening their trust and bonds with other players and move further away from the anti-Cheddar sentiment that had been plaguing them for the past few votes. Darby also walks away with an extra vote in this episode that no one knows about, which may come in handy down the road. However, Darby has been clocked by some players as an emerging threat and will need to tone it down if they want to make FTC without winning out.

<strong>Mamo</strong> falls to the third position this episode solely because Darby was able to find really solid footing with the majority taking some of the power away from Mamo. While Mamo is still in a very strong position, they have been very visible with how they are pushing votes and if they are not careful that could rub some players the wrong way. 

<strong>Lavender</strong> falls to the fourth spot this episode for continuously taking the back seat to Sificon on votes which can be a good thing and a bad thing. Lavender is well positioned enough to avoid targeting for a few votes but they are also becoming slightly too passive which can hurt their overall perception and may end up leaving them on the outs if things don’t change soon. However, Lavender can also utilize this position to take part in some blindsides and then when the time is right flip on Sificon and find themselves in a strong position right before FTC. Only time will tell if Lavender will flip or flop.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1079984186468864082 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1079984186468864082><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/27/2023 11:31 PM">23:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span>

The player with the highest power ranking to little surprise is Darby, they have been seen as an all around threat for awhile now and that continues to be reflected in their score here. Right under Darby is Sificon which is also of little surprise, they have made multiple connections at this point of the game and are universally liked by everyone. A little more surprising is Sunder having the third highest power ranking at this point of the game, this contrasts their trust rankings which have been near the middle of the pack lately so it is a little confusing to how Sunder is being labeled as a threat this early in the merge. These three players will have to do some major management to make it to the end, but if they make it there they will have a great chance to win. 

Next up in the middle we have Penny Lavender and Mamo, they are all kind of in the golden zone you would want to be at this point for power rankings as they should not be immediately targeted for being a big threat to win the game but can still have win equity if they make it to the end. If these three players can keep this up they will be in a great position to make the end and potentially win. 

Lastly is the final four of Typo Ani Shane and Swiss who all scored pretty poorly this time around. All of these players will need to start doing some moves or change their game state if they want a chance to win the game. Especially Swiss who is last in power rankings by far, they will really need to start shaking things up in order to win the game.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ultimately most of the stray votes were accounted for in one way or another so most players felt relatively at ease. Coming into the challenge the players were tasked with playing Liar’s Dice in a single elimination mini-tournament where Mamo came out on top. With his newfound power, Mamo sought out to form an alliance with some of his loosely connected allies (namely Typo, Darby, Sificon and Ani) to try and push the vote in a favorable direction. The two players in contention for the vote were Swiss and Shane, and while Mamo initially pushed hard for Swiss, multiple players felt that it made more sense to target Shane. Penny, Shane and Lavender would ultimately target Swiss as they perceived him as the easy target, leading to them being blindsided in a 6-3 vote against Shane. 

Darby, Mamo, Sificon and Typo all earn CPs this episode for their collective push to break up the Brie v Cotija narrative and take out Shane. Mamo earns an M tone however for trying to initially strong arm the vote towards Swiss but eventually settling on Mamo, earning some mixed reception from his new alliance members. Penny and Swiss both get OTTNs once again this episode for their continued vocal aggression towards each other and consistently failing to actually target and eliminate each other. Many players at this point see Swiss and Penny as slightly volatile numbers they can use to further their own agenda and not as players who they view as threatening to them at FTC. Lastly, Shane gets an M tone this episode for once again being targeted as one of the two potential votes even though he was considered to be kept as a number they could use. Unfortunately, luck was not on his side this episode as players finally settled on making him the main vote allowing Swiss to slip away once again.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1079996001970044938 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1079996001970044938><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/28/2023 12:18 AM">00:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1079996022056570991 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1079996022056570991><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/28/2023 12:18 AM">00:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>CONTENDERS</strong></em>

<strong>Sificon</strong> is still holding strong at number one. He has been consistent in all aspects of the game, being a member of nearly every alliance there currently is. Sificon also continues to manage his relationships well, being a good ally for everyone and not making anyone question his loyalty. He is at the center of the game but no one has really noticed yet which is a wonderful position to be in. He is not only in the know for where every vote could be going, but is a primary decision maker on where it does end up. He just has to be careful that no one else identifies him as the threat he is.

<strong>Darby</strong> stays at number two for his continued social and strategic game. He is also a part of almost all the alliances that exist and is a key decision maker for what those alliances do. Everyone wants to work with Darby, and his main flaw right now is that everyone also knows that. At this rate, his game is super strong and he has an incredibly strong case for FTC, but the others are catching on to this. If Darby stays vigilant he can manage this threat level or at least know when someone is trying to take a shot at him, as he still is holding a Hidden Immunity Idol and Extra Vote.

<strong>Mamo</strong> stays in third and had a great episode bolstered by his first Individual Immunity win! Mamo also solidifies his strong positioning at the top of the game by solidifying his alliance with Darby and Sificon, the other strongest players in the game. He was also at the center of this vote, as many people proclaimed it would be &quot;King Mamo&quot; who made the ultimate decision. This attention is not great though, as it is becoming pretty apparent that he is at the top of the food chain. If Mamo lets some other threats become even larger than him, he can make it to the end and have a great case, but right now the ground he is standing on is showing signs of giving way.

<strong>Typo</strong> makes it back on contenders for the first time since swap. His excellent work under the radar has put him here as there aren&#39;t many people looking to take him out any time soon. It certainly helps that he also has a Hidden Immunity Idol, but the attention is on everyone else right now. He has also been in many of the most important conversations for the game thus far, so if he does find himself at FTC he has a pretty solid game to back himself up there. He just has to stay under the radar and not pop up too soon.

<strong>Lavender</strong> falls off the rankings this episode for still taking the back seat with everyone. This has now landed them on the wrong side of the vote for the first time this season. It is getting down to the final stretch and the passive play style just won&#39;t be enough to succeed at or even make FTC. His inexperience is starting to show and he isn&#39;t in the more comfortable position he was prior to this episode.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1079996092122419222 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1079996092122419222><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02/28/2023 12:18 AM">00:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span>

Still killing it at the top is Sificon who has been near the top of trust rankings since swap. Multiple people see him as a number one, and only Ani sees him near the bottom. Darby and Mamo are also still near the top of trust with Darby moving up slightly. Now we get into one of the biggest shifts of the merge with Typo shooting all the way to fourth after being at the very bottom at the start of merge. 

Penny continues to be near the middle of the pack but is starting to trend down a little bit compared to earlier in the game. Now for the biggest faller since last time Lavender, after being near the top of trust for the entire game they are starting to dip near the bottom of trust.They are still trusted well by the people they have been alligned with for awhile but they lack a lot of trust from people outside of their core. 

The bottom consists of Swiss Ani and Shane. Swiss has not improved much from last time while Ani and Shane have dipped a bit being tied for last. Shane especially is seen as the least trust worthy from most of his tribe with the one saving grace being Lavender still trusting them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Following a blindside on Shane it finally seemed like there were no more outs left for Swiss. There were no more players left who people were willing to target before Swiss, and most players felt it was still too early to take a shot on some of the bigger names. Swiss’s only hope for survival seemed to be winning immunity, but Mamo was able to once again secure immunity, seemingly sealing Swiss’s fate. Luckily for Swiss, there was in fact one last spark of hope, Typo. Typo tried to push the vote off of Swiss a bit, but realized that it was not going to be possible, so he decided to do something quite crazingo and give his idol to Swiss. Along with Ani, Typo and Swiss decided to put their votes on Penny to ensure that in the case of a split there was no chance of anyone else other than Penny going home. Ultimately the gambit paid off with 5 votes on Swiss negated by the idol, and 3 votes on Penny, making Penny the 4th member of the jury. The unsung smart play of the episode goes to Darby who had debated for awhile it it made sense to work with Ani, Swiss and Typo and use their extra vote to take out Penny, but after a lot of deliberation decided to vote with the majority since they knew that the vote would be falling on someone else other than themselves.

Ani, Darby, Swiss and Typo all earn CPs this episode for their strategic deliberations around the vote and decisions that would put all of them in a fairly strong position moving forward. Typo gets a P tone for their heroic attempt to save Swiss without the idol and also for giving Swiss the idol to make a play and not get as much heat from the fallout as he would have if he had played it on Swiss. Swiss gets an M tone for being disliked and targeted by multiple players, but also for being saved by Typo, for escaping another vote and for working closely with Ani. Penny gets a OTT tone this episode for their continued one note attitude towards targeting Swiss which finally caught up with her, causing her to be the one Swiss targeted with the idol. Penny also gets an M tone for being trusted by the majority even after being blindsided at the prior vote and for being able to get the votes needed to target Swiss finally, but also for being too locked into targeting Swiss which affected her game and some of her relationships.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081356922365673633 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081356922365673633><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:26 PM">18:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081356961779568721 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081356961779568721><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:26 PM">18:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>CONTENDERS</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081357024710897754 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081357024710897754><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:26 PM">18:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>Sificon</strong> finds himself in the number one position for the 7th episode in a row! So far Sificon has managed to be in the majority on every vote while maintaining their high trust and power ranking yet still not being considered a target for the vote. He has a strong grip on the game and it seems like many players want to work with Sificon in the long run and a few are even considering taking him to FTC. If Sificon can retain this perception for just a few more votes he will easily sweep at FTC with an incredibly dominant and well-rounded game.

<strong>Darby</strong> also keeps their number two position for the third episode in a row. Like Sificon, he has been able to work his way into the majority and vote right at every tribal council, however multiple players have clocked Darby as a potential threat and aren’t as willing to work with Darby long-term as they are with Sificon. However, Darby has a couple of tricks up his sleeve that could ultimately turn the tide in his favor, but those tricks are also the same things that will make people want to target him before they target Sificon. If Darby is able to play his cards right, he could take out Sificon and push through another vote or two before it will become imperative that he wins immunity to make it to the end. A tall order for sure, but if any player can pull that off, it would be Darby.

<strong>Typo</strong> moves into the third position this episode just narrowly beating out <strong>Mamo</strong>. Typo has shown to be a strategic and social threat throughout the season, and after the last episode with giving Swiss the idol he just seems to be slightly pulling ahead of Mamo in terms of win equity. So far Typo doesn’t appear to be on anyone’s radar to target soon, and he has one of the strongest games of the remaining players. While Mamo does have some individual immunities under his belt, players have begun to notice Mamo as a threat and are debating on taking him out sooner than later.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:27 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081357153958371449 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081357153958371449><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:27 PM">18:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081357470523457646 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081357470523457646><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:28 PM">18:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__embed><a href=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1057417128426348594/1080230081550631093/image.png> <img class=chatlog__embed-generic-image src=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1057417128426348594/1080230081550631093/image.png alt="Embedded image" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081357492631646238 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081357492631646238><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:28 PM">18:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Power Rankings</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081357596562309240 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081357596562309240><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:29 PM">18:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1081357725713318009 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1081357725713318009><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:29 PM">18:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Power rankings this time around just like trust rankings have not seen a ton of change compared to last time. 

Darby and Sificon are both still at the top of the list with Darby having the number one spot. People very clearly see them as a threat to win and thus everyone will probably want to take them out before the end of the game when they get a chance. 

Mamo and Typo are up next in that middle ground area having a higher power ranking then last time, most notably Typo. They might need to be a little cautious with the coming cycles otherwise they could be in danger. 

Ani is right behind them improving their power slightly compared to last time but that also might have to do more so with the next two players. Penny and Lavender both have fallen a lot compared to last time, they have gone from being in a good middle position to being near the bottom of the list. Both players will have to change up what they are doing otherwise they might be doomed at the end. 

Lastly is Swiss who has not moved from the last place spot and it might be too late to change this without something major.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03/03/2023 6:29 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The challenge for the episode was a speedrun of the game “Swordfish” and for most of the players it was fairly neck and neck. Only Mamo and Lavender had times that weren’t within one minute of the rest, but it seemed as if Mamo was throwing the challenge on purpose to lower their threat level. As for Lavender, they just seemed to not like the speedrun itself and after a single attempt decided to not continue going for immunity. Ultimately Sificon would end up winning their second immunity of the season, leaving only a few options on the table in terms of realistic boots. The Cotija group had set their eyes on Swiss once again, thinking that there were no more tricks for them to play. The Brie group was debating between Mamo and Darby, but ultimately decided on targeting Darby as they knew Darby had some advantage and had a pretty high threat level, so a blindside on Darby could bolster their own resumes. Ani, Swiss and Typo set out to try and find someone to flip to their side for the vote, and were able to find that temporary ally with Sificon who was comfortable making the move while having immunity. Although Darby had felt some suspicions regarding how the votes would shake out, they ultimately chose to not play their idol or extra vote, sending them home with both in their pocket.

Ani, Sificon, Swiss and Typo all earn CPs this episode for their plan to target Darby, eliminating a strong contender and taking out two advantages all in one shot. Sificon earns an  M tone however for being very wishy-washy with their decision on who to vote, annoying the Brie members and also upsetting the Cotija members. Swiss also earns an M tone for once again being targeted for the vote, being the number one enemy of the Cotijas while also being beloved and a shield for the Brie members. Mamo and Darby get MORs for their attempt at a simple vote on Swiss that would backfire on them, sending Darby home and leaving Mamo on the outs. Lavender gets a UTR this episode for barely being around and talking minimal strategy, only getting enough info to throw a vote on Swiss, which ended up being incorrect anyway.

<em><strong>CONTENDERS</strong></em>

<strong>Typo</strong> has a finger directly on the pulse of this game. Great reads, lots of game awareness, he’s not the biggest threat, he’s not on anyone’s radar - Even one of his biggest allies thinks that they could beat him in the end. He had a solid early game, he managed to worm his way out of a tight mid-merge where he was nearly pegged as a much bigger threat, and now he could potentially be in it for the home stretch with the Brie Team. His win equity is only growing, and his continuous move making these past few episodes has really bumped him up - That jury management is also nothing to sneeze at, he has a decently fair shot at all of the current jury votes.

<strong>Sificon</strong> drops for the first time in SEVEN whole episodes. That threat level is finally catching up to him, and we’ll be sad to see it potentially eat him alive. Before he even won immunity, people were thinking about turning on him to get him out. He also has all it takes to win, but people are finally starting to notice. Things aren’t set in stone, so who knows if the Brie strong trio will want to turn on him so soon (especially after gaining him as a number this episode) but if they don’t… That only works better for his game in the end. 

<strong>Mamo</strong> rises up to the third spot on the contenders list this episode. With the right strategy and a clutch immunity (or two) Mamo could find themselves at FTC with a lot of allies on the jury, a handful of immunity wins and a bit of an underdog story. However, Mamo has been seen before as a threat and if they are not careful and don’t flip the script soon, it could be him who is targeted next, ending his game just shy of FTC.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:18 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082119092116410419 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082119092116410419><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/05/2023 8:54 PM">20:54</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03/05/2023 8:55 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082119172936454214 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082119172936454214><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/05/2023 8:55 PM">20:55</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082119298476159027 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082119298476159027><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/05/2023 8:55 PM">20:55</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1082119298589409390/image.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055989687942127626/1082119298589409390/image.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (97.42 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082119345775321148 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082119345775321148><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/05/2023 8:55 PM">20:55</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Trust Rankings</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082119351324385332 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082119351324385332><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/05/2023 8:55 PM">20:55</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082119511857168384 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082119511857168384><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/05/2023 8:56 PM">20:56</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As we have come to expect, Sificon still remains at the top of trust rankings, a place they have not fell from since the start of the swap tribe phase of the game.

Coming up right behind is Typo and Darby who have followed different paths this merge. While Darby has always had a solid trust rankings the entire game, Typo has climbed all the way from the bottom of trust to the top of trust throughout merge. They have put a ton of work to change their spot in this game. 

Next is Swiss and Ani, Swiss has seen major improvement from being at the bottom almost all of merge to being in the middle, part of which could just be from their biggest allies still being in the game while their enemies have been voted out. Ani on the other hand has been pretty steady in their position this merge. 

Lastly is Lavender and Mamo who both have seen a major fall from their previous highs in this game. They do not have a ton of true allies left and may be left in the dust as this merge goes on.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Things were looking grim for Mamo as even if he were able to pull in Lavender and Sificon, it would still lead to a 3 - 3 tie and Sificon was not even willing to work with Mamo here, let alone go to rocks for him. It seemed that Mamo’s fate would ultimately be tied with winning the challenge, but unfortunately for him Swiss was able to walk away with the coveted immunity win after blowing the competition away in Cnid’s Escape Room™. Although there was an effort from Mamo to sway Sificon to his side and reach out to Lavender, those pleas fell on deaf ears. However, some ears were more deaf than others as Lavender unfortunately was not present for the entirety of the cycle, and after numerous attempts to reach out to them by production both in and out of the server, Lavender was pulled from the game. Although Mamo was able to squeak by on this vote, things are still looking grim for his future and he may need to win out if he wants a chance at making it to FTC.

Ani, Sificon, Swiss and Typo all earn CPs this episode for their strong grip on the tribe at F6 and targeting of Mamo for his perception of being a challenge threat. Mamo gets a MOR this episode for some attempts to save themselves, but ultimately realizing that these pitches were falling on deaf ears. Lavender earns an INV for being missing during the entire cycle, ultimately being medevac&#39;d.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083604219879247943 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083604219879247943><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:16 PM">23:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083604226392997980 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083604226392997980><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:16 PM">23:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>CONTENDERS</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083604327211483206 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083604327211483206><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:16 PM">23:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>Typo</strong> once again retains his first place position on the contenders list this episode. Not much has changed since last episode, and with the medevac of Lavender it seems that the Brie trio is in an incredibly strong position and can steamroll to FTC barring a clutch immunity win from Lavender or Mamo. Of the three Bries, Typo has the highest win equity and a fairly well managed threat level. As long as he doesn’t make any critical mistakes he seems to be a lock for FTC unless his allies figure out just how strong his case really is.

<strong>Sificon</strong> stays in the second place position this episode as they arguably have the largest win equity of the rest of the cast, with Typo most likely being the only one to truly contend with them at FTC. However, their threat level does seem to be noticed by most of their tribemates and now that the numbers are slim it is likely that Sificon could become a fallen angel. However, Sificon does seem to be strong in challenges and it is very possible for them to win the next two immunities and secure their place (and possibly the win) in the end.

<strong>Swiss</strong> rises up to the third spot on the contenders list this episode as they have managed to build quite the resume episode after episode, dodging vote after vote while making moves that seemed to strengthen their position each time. The biggest thing holding Swiss back from a higher place on the contenders list is that their social game with some jurors left much to be desired, but with a bit of ass kissing at FTC and another strong move (or two) they could easily find themselves the frontrunner.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:18 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083604822177091634 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083604822177091634><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:18 PM">23:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__embed><a href=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1057417128426348594/1082109075975847987/image.png> <img class=chatlog__embed-generic-image src=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1057417128426348594/1082109075975847987/image.png alt="Embedded image" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083604855890919434 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083604855890919434><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:18 PM">23:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Power Rankings</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083604863092543510 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083604863092543510><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:18 PM">23:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083604952133410887 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083604952133410887><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:19 PM">23:19</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Continuing the same old song and dance, Sificon remains at the top of the power rankings.

If Sifi makes it to the end it could very well be a sweep. 

Coming up next is Mamo who is still riding near the top, who in contrast to Sifi has been labeled as a threat that needs to go if people wanna win. 

In third we have Swiss who has climbed up the power ranks ladder to a respectable position and is now seeing the light at the end of the tunnel to maybe pull out the win. 

Typo is in a weird spot where some people see him as the biggest threat to win while others see him as a non threat, this will either be very good for Typo or very bad depending on who makes the jury among the remaining players. 

Lastly we have Ani and Lavender who stay at the bottom of power rankings. Both players can potentially squeeze out some votes at the end but it will be an uphill battle to win for sure</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03/09/2023 11:19 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was only one problem with that plan - They wanted to take each other out to build their resumes and give themselves unique stories at FTC. Initially the Bries had considered targeting Mamo or Sificon, but at this point all of the players began to realize that Mamo had lost a lot of power in the game and would likely have a hard time beating them at FTC. As for Sificon, while they were concerned about the threat that Sificon possessed, they all felt it would make sense to work with them for one more vote in order to safely take a shot at each other and then take them out at F4. 

Ultimately it would be Ani who would win immunity this episode after narrowly beating Swiss in Cheesepardy, securing their place at F4 and giving them some momentum to safely take a shot on one of the other Bries. Typo made the first move by reaching out to Sificon and Mamo to target Swiss, which both of them were happy to oblige. Ani and Swiss on the other hand were still debating whether taking the shot on Typo made sense to do now, or if they should target Mamo or Sificon and guarantee themselves a spot with numbers at F4. Behind the scenes things were looking grim for Swiss as Typo had rallied the numbers, but after a conversation in which Swiss jokingly asked Sificon if he was going to take him out, Sificon panicked thinking the plan had leaked and spilled everything. Swiss panicked knowing that Sificon was targeting them and confronted Typo who openly admitted to the plan. Ultimately this would cause Swiss to realize that if they didn’t target Typo this round, it would be them who went home instead. Swiss was able to have an 11th hour conversation with Ani and Sificon and was able to successfully convince them to vote for Typo, sending Typo home in a very last minute 3-2 vote.

Typo, Swiss, Ani and Sificon all earn CPs this episode for their strategic targeting and planning for their individual endgames. Swiss earns an M tone for once again being targeted for the vote, but also for discovering the plan to blindside them and scrambling at the last minute to pull off an incredible blindside. Typo earns an N tone this episode for planning on taking out one of their allies over other strong contenders and for confirming to Swiss before the vote that they were the target, ultimately leading to his own blindside.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083620871622635532 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083620871622635532><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/10/2023 12:22 AM">00:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083620904254328872 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083620904254328872><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/10/2023 12:22 AM">00:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>CONTENDERS</strong></em>

<strong>Sificon</strong> jumps back up to first place this episode after once again avoiding being targeted in a vote where they probably should have gone home. With Typo gone there isn’t a lot standing in Sificon’s way to making it to FTC and likely winning. If Sificon can pull off one more immunity win they can guarantee themselves a spot in the end and have an incredibly strong story to pitch. However, their threat level is incredibly high at this point and should they lose the next challenge they will likely become a fallen angel, but knowing Sificon anything can happen.

<strong>Swiss</strong> rises up to second on the contenders list this episode as they have found themselves in quite a strong position in F4 with a very strong resume, possibly stronger than Sificons. However, their social game throughout the season was a bit choppy at times and if Sificon is able to make FTC it would be quite an uphill battle for Swiss to win, but if they are able to take out Sificon at F4 or make a very convincing plea to the jury they may just be able to walk away with an incredibly fun and crazy villainous win.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083621106692395108 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083621106692395108><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/10/2023 12:23 AM">00:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__embed><a href=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1057417128426348594/1082814691291693056/image.png> <img class=chatlog__embed-generic-image src=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1057417128426348594/1082814691291693056/image.png alt="Embedded image" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083621135398223893 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083621135398223893><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/10/2023 12:23 AM">00:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Trust Rankings</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083621142687911946 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083621142687911946><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/10/2023 12:23 AM">00:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1083621302046302258 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1083621302046302258><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/10/2023 12:24 AM">00:24</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>For our final trust rankings of the season, what else could be expected then Sificon still remaining first place in trust. Sifi has been in first place for almost the entire game at this point and somehow it keeps getting better with 3 people putting Sifi in first place and just one lone last place vote. 

Swiss has crawled all the way from the bottom to second place in trust. Swiss has been on a roller coaster this entire merge and when it matters most has settled nicely. 

Typo is tied with Swiss continuing his stretch of placing high. 

Ani and Mamo fall into last place for trust rankings, Ani has remained near the bottom to middle for the entire merge while Mamo has dropped quite a bit putting him in last overall.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, as with many things this season, it&#39;s best to expect the unexpected. The final challenge was a gauntlet consisting of past challenges, and while it was a fairly tight race, it was ultimately Sificon who would pull out the clutch immunity securing their place at FTC. Swiss and Ani made a deal to give each other fire, and both decided to target Mamo. Mamo approached Sificon about who to target and while Sificon was a bit wishy washy, they decided that Swiss was the right target. Mamo, concerned about Sificon’s indecisiveness, decided to reach out to Swiss about pulling off one final blindside. The pitch was that if Mamo tells Sificon to target Swiss and Swiss tells Ani to target Mamo, together the two can target Ani and pull off a 2-1-1. Swiss, seeing an opportunity, agreed to this plan to get Mamo to switch their vote to Ani, but did not switch themselves, causing Mamo to effectively vote themself out just shy of FTC. 

Sificon, Mamo and Swiss all earn CPs for their strategic thoughts and attempts at swaying the votes in a direction that benefitted them. Mamo earns an M tone this episode for trying to make a last ditch effort to save themselves and gain as much win equity as they could before FTC, but also for a major misplay which ultimately led to him voting himself out. Swiss earns an N tone this episode for their deception on Mamo at the last second, potentially burning an important juror who may become the deciding vote at what appears to be a very close FTC.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084197585398546462 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084197585398546462><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/11/2023 2:34 PM">14:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084197625550610502 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084197625550610502><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03/11/2023 2:34 PM">14:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>CONTENDERS</strong></em>

<strong>Sificon</strong> retains the top spot for the final episode as they have played an incredibly well rounded game and have quite the resume coming into FTC. However, Sificon has been seen as very indecisive and flip floppy by the jury which could spell trouble for them if they are unable to sell their game correctly.

<strong>Swiss</strong> is the other major contender coming into FTC as they have successfully found a way to make FTC after receiving votes at every tribal since F10. On paper Swiss may have the strongest game out of anyone, however their jury management was a bit rough with some members of the jury, and Swiss will need to do quite a bit of ass kissing if they want to pull out the win.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Without immunity he surely would have been a goner and the rest of the players may have to hope the jury does not see him in the same way. 

Swiss comes right behind Sificon who just like trust has crawled all the way to second after being in last a large part of this merge. Where as one point Swiss may have had no shot to win they now have a reasonable shot to win. 

Ani comes in third and will need a killer pitch and the other FTC members to flop if they want things to go their way if they were to make FTC. 

In last is Mamo who will have to hope the jury is a bit bitter and respects his endgame survivability and social skills should he make FTC if he wants to win this game.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
