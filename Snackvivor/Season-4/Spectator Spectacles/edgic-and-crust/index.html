Spirits were high at the Sake tribe, as the energetic new castaways dominated in the first challenge. <strong>Jenna</strong> was able to do a lot of legwork for the more specific items, while <strong>Pickles</strong> and <strong>Kyran</strong> focused on art, and <strong>Zacharie</strong> and <strong>Winley</strong> on video tasks. However, everyone contributed to a variety of categories on the challenge, allowing them to keep up a quick pace. Sake were able to come together to complete more teamwork oriented tasks than any tribe, netting them the highest score in the challenge of 39 out of a possible 48 points! On the social side, <strong>Jenna</strong> and <strong>Pickles</strong> were able to connect early and quickly become each other’s most trusted, establishing a flow of information on their tribe that netted them both CPs. <strong>Zacharie</strong> was one of the quieter voices on the tribe and in the challenge, but their impeccable selfie game and charisma had them viewed positively by the tribe and got them a low visibility MORP rating. In contrast, after <strong>Winley</strong> had a very productive performance at the beginning of the challenge, people felt conversations stalling out in 1on1s which caused them to fall to the bottom of the trust rankings. That, combined with Winley feeling sick and being unavailable to contribute after the night of the challenge announcement got them a MORM rating. <strong>Kyran</strong> had a decent prescience in the challenge, but connected most to Zacharie who was around the least, and was immediately wary of Jenna who he perceived to be a strong threat. Overall, Kyran’s lack of connection to active players  caused him to drop in the trust rankings and got him a MOR for the episode.

<em><strong>Unagi:</strong></em> <img

The Unagi tribe was a storm of social activity, especially for not having a tribal to go to! Right off the bat, <strong>Etay</strong>, <strong>PBJ</strong>, and <strong>Annie</strong> are chatting it up and quickly realize that they all want to work together. They form an alliance they call APEs, and begin talking there regularly. This earns PBJ and Annie CP ratings for the episode, as they were members of the key trio on Unagi as well as did great work on the challenge. Etay gets an OTT though, for being a bit too focused on the immediate social activity of the tribe. His constant emphasis on one-on-one message counts showed that he might read too much into certain details of the game. The other tribe members, <strong>Fones</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> were notably less present than the APEs trio. They contributed some to the challenge and some to the social game, but it was noted they were clearly less active than the others. This gets them both UTR ratings, since they kept up with the tribe but were not major contributors to the dynamics.

The Ebi tribe was a bit of a mixed bag in terms of player activity and sociability. <strong>Noah</strong> and <strong>Taco</strong> were fairly inactive at the start, leading <strong>Mana</strong>, <strong>Sky</strong> and <strong>Treb</strong> to come together as a trio, reinforced by their activity and performance in the challenge. While they ultimately were not able to pick up enough slack to avoid tribal, <strong>Treb</strong> created an alliance with <strong>Mana</strong> and <strong>Sky</strong> called <strong>Slay-Ebiday</strong> which would become crucial for the next few votes. <strong>Taco</strong> sensing that he may be in danger attempted to form an alliance with <strong>Treb</strong> and <strong>Sky</strong>, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The Ebiday’s had to decide between <strong>Taco</strong> and <strong>Noah</strong> and although <strong>Taco</strong> was more active, the overall negative reception to his challenge performance coupled with the understanding that <strong>Noah</strong> was busy the first two days was enough to lean towards <strong>Taco</strong>. The vote would be a simple 4-1 with <strong>Taco</strong> being eliminated and <strong>Noah</strong> receiving the stray vote. <strong>Treb</strong> gets a CPP for his overall positive perception from the tribe, his challenge performance, strategic musings and for bringing together the <strong>Slay-Ebiday</strong> group. <strong>Mana</strong> and <strong>Sky</strong> both get P tones for their upbeat attitudes and reception from their tribemates. <strong>Taco</strong> gets an N tone for his slight attitude during the challenge which rubbed his tribemates the wrong way. <strong>Noah</strong> gets a UTR for being basically inactive for the first two days outside of a couple short messages.

<em><strong>Hokkigai:</strong></em> <img

    title="hokkigaikiss"
    src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1096897391782797353.png"> 

The Hokkigai tribe got off to a much slower start out of the gate, seeing significantly less activity in comparison to the other tribes.  Dylan became unable to participate in the game due to irl commitments, and was substituted for <strong>Aura</strong>.  The more hands-off approach of Hokkigai was felt not only in the minimal communication among the tribe, but in the scavenger hunt bingo challenge as well.  The first night of the challenge saw <strong>Dicy</strong> be the only member to submit any items, and not a single bingo was scored until the next day.  After a night of relaxing, <strong>Slaytan</strong> went into overdrive and ended up contributing the most items of any castaway.  <strong>Rob</strong> and <strong>Aura</strong> were able to add a few items to the tally as well.  Sadly, this effort was not enough to overcome the early deficit, and Hokkigai faced the first tribal council of the season.  On a more positive note, there was a clear consensus among the tribe with regard to the direction of the vote.  <strong>Leroy</strong> had been completely inactive since the marooning, failing to contribute to the challenge or discuss the impending vote, resulting in his unanimous elimination.  Due to the straightforward nature of this cycle, no official alliances were formed, although the social center of the tribe appears to be the pair of <strong>Dicy</strong> and <strong>Slaytan</strong>.  <strong>Dicy</strong> nets the only CP rating of the tribe for his early positioning as well as the strong game aptitude displayed in his confessionals.  MORs and UTRs abound for the remaining members of the tribe,  with the exception of <strong>Leroy</strong>, whose INV status led to his permanent disappearance from the game in the form of a torch snuff.

The episode one contenders were incredibly tricky to narrow down - This cast has been amazing so far, and there are so many stand out competitors! <strong>Treb</strong> is topping us up though, with a great opening to the season!! As mentioned before, he has a very good set up on Ebi. He’s very talkative, which was received well by all of his tribemates, and he put lots of effort into the challenge and game talk! That trio alliance, his connection with Mana, and his high social ability will all contribute to his future success. Following right behind him is <strong>PBJ</strong>. Unagi is looking great right now, and PBJ certainly seems to have what it takes to make that work in her favor. Contributing lots to challenges, immediately setting up a power trio, using her weaknesses to her advantage - it makes her very strong, and gives her a great game sense. She’s easily the best person to align yourself with on that tribe. 

Next up is <strong>Dicy</strong>! He was the the most active member of Hokkigai by far, and knows that he can easily sail out of this tribe into swap - And knows what he can do to make that happen. The musings in his confessional show the strength of his game sense, and his ability to position himself in a way that nearly guarantees his success in the coming rounds… On this tribe, or on the next. <strong>Jenna</strong> is rounding out our list - Which makes these contenders have one member of every tribe! How fun!! Sake had less going on this cycle, but Jenna proved herself with activity levels and strategic thinking in her confessionals, as well as creating a solid connection with Pickles that was returned wholeheartedly!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098458532313051278 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098458532313051278><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:02 AM">12:02 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098458569831108618 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098458569831108618><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:02 AM">12:02 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>TRUST RANKINGS:</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098459130651484252 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098459130651484252><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:04 AM">12:04 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098459130450169966/image.png?ex=655ecf49&amp;is=654c5a49&amp;hm=f94a151a0799620eb01b868d0f454efc0433db133642c2aad343feafd18ce3bb&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098459130450169966/image.png?ex=655ecf49&amp;is=654c5a49&amp;hm=f94a151a0799620eb01b868d0f454efc0433db133642c2aad343feafd18ce3bb&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (83.71 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098459136703864832 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098459136703864832><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:04 AM">12:04 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Hokkigai</strong>

Hokkigai is pretty straight forward for trust rankings coming out of the gate Dicy and Slayton both received the same score at the top of their tribe, even getting the same amount of first place trusts and second place trusts. Rob is directly behind them being seen as number 2 to most people. Aura and Leroy both are at the back of the pack who both scored only third places or last places respectively. Unfortunately Leroy had to go on a trip to Mars and his rankings were lost in the mail so there are some unknowns on tribe dynamics but it may not even matter. (it did not).</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098459258321907715 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098459258321907715><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:04 AM">12:04 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098459258493861939/image.png?ex=655ecf67&amp;is=654c5a67&amp;hm=32a8e11313e4ad3af3e321b5d18ee49ea5d22820a1e573cd76f0584cc1e95824&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098459258493861939/image.png?ex=655ecf67&amp;is=654c5a67&amp;hm=32a8e11313e4ad3af3e321b5d18ee49ea5d22820a1e573cd76f0584cc1e95824&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (62.78 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098459267599700038 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098459267599700038><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:04 AM">12:04 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Ebi</strong>

Coming in first on Unagi we have Etay who is trusted by everyone on the tribe being first or second by everyone. Annie is right behind Etay but due to the slight distrust from Fones falls just short. And just behind Annie is PBJ who is usually seen as the second closest ally to most people. One thing of note is each of these players is someone&#39;s number one at least once. Fones and Stephen are at the back of the group with Fones being seen as the 3rd most trusted by everyone and Stephen scoring the imperfect trust ranking of being last in everyone&#39;s eyes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098459513226526751 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098459513226526751><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:05 AM">12:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098459513004249128/image.png?ex=655ecfa4&amp;is=654c5aa4&amp;hm=d3fc25df1a3a55ac7d64b22be3cef85793a819a0cdd22e51a280bce15a4b5fd6&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098459513004249128/image.png?ex=655ecfa4&amp;is=654c5aa4&amp;hm=d3fc25df1a3a55ac7d64b22be3cef85793a819a0cdd22e51a280bce15a4b5fd6&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (83.48 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098459517613768804 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098459517613768804><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:05 AM">12:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Sake</strong>

The Sake tribe has the most interesting dynamic of trust with pretty much everyone being within close range of each other. Pickles Zacharie Jenna and Kyran are all someone&#39;s number 1. Pickles gets a little ahead of everyone due to two first places. The other three players in this group are also someones least trusted so there are a lot of ways a tribal here could play out.

<strong> </strong>
HELLO AND WELCOME TO HOST EDGIC which is definitely going to be a thing and I won&#39;t get sick and really behind this season! And to attone for that I&#39;m just gonna give myself (Sappho, me thats me) a UTRNN5. We start out strong with some new additions, all of those new additions adding great jokes to prod VC and most importantly, laughing at my jokes. Cheese continues his homophobic reign this season and interrupted me a few times earning him an OTTN, but that&#39;s not nearly as bad as Fish who programmed his stupid Bot, who also gets its own score, to @ me every so often when I mention my wife. OTTNN for fish because he&#39;s a little bitch, and the legendary NNN for the bot because it doesn&#39;t even do the things we need it to sometimes outside of roast people. Han&#39;s tribal was a thing that happened!! But more importantly they saved 69 puppies from a burning building. OTTPP hero of the season. Dino continues to rake in stars, surpassing me in star count and earning him an OTTPP. The specs this cycle were not only well behaved, but asked thoughtful and provoking questions to our contestants! You&#39;re getting such a good grade in host edgic school which is both normal to want and possible to achieve.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:09 AM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098460265256861817/image.png?ex=655ed057&amp;is=654c5b57&amp;hm=7c31b520b3e8c0868cbd1f6be0629abb243d208bd6f48b8c6199599ec7c9230f&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1098460265256861817/image.png?ex=655ed057&amp;is=654c5b57&amp;hm=7c31b520b3e8c0868cbd1f6be0629abb243d208bd6f48b8c6199599ec7c9230f&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (32.34 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098460296223408199 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098460296223408199><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:09 AM">12:09 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098460448938008696 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098460448938008696><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 12:09 AM">12:09 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong><u>CONTENDERS</u></strong>

Sake tribe started off the episode riding high after avoiding tribal the previous round.  As a result of their previous victory, <strong>Kyran</strong> was sent to <em><strong>The Tank</strong></em> by Hokkigai, becoming the first castaway to take a dip into this watery unknown along with PBJ.  After spending the entirety of the first night in the holding area, Kyran ultimately elected to explore the more difficult-to-navigate Fishing Dock, but he and PBJ were unable to uncover the extent of its mysteries.  Meanwhile, the Coupnament challenge was underway, which saw <strong>Winley</strong> be the only member from Sake to advance to the final round, where they placed fourth.  Facing tribal council for the first time, the social dynamics of Sake were less defined compared to other tribes, as they were lacking in both a strong core alliance and an inactive member to serve as an easy boot.  However, within an hour after the challenge, chaos began to ensue with <strong>Winley</strong> at the center of it.  First, they revealed to <strong>Jenna</strong> their intent to send Etay to <em><strong>The Tank</strong></em> in order to keep him alive long enough to connect with at a swap.  Then, they went to <strong>Pickles</strong> with an elaborate plan to eliminate <strong>Kyran</strong> while throwing their own vote on <strong>Jenna</strong> in case of an idol play. Alarmed by this erratic playstyle and not wanting to risk losing Jenna, <strong>Pickles</strong> confided in her with Winley&#39;s plans, and the two were able to able to pull in Kyran and <strong>Zacharie</strong> to send Winley home 4-1. <strong>Winley</strong> received an OTTN rating due to their scheming being met with confusion and dismay by the rest of the tribe.  <strong>Jenna</strong> and <strong>Pickles</strong> earn CPs for formulating the vote and further cementing their social and strategic connection with each other, while <strong>Zacharie</strong> and <strong>Kyran</strong> were less strategically instrumental, and get MORs.

Camp was quiet but friendly at the Hokkigai tribe, where <strong>Rob</strong> was able to secure immunity for the tribe and a day off from the tribe. Having set up no alliances after the first vote, the tribe is unified but lacks a clear voting bloc. <strong>Rob</strong> enjoyed being celebrated by the tribe for carrying them to the win in the coup-nament, earning him an OTTP rating. <strong>Dicy</strong> and <strong>Aura</strong> connected a bit in 1on1s, although they failed to build trust or set up an alliance, netting them MORs. <strong>Dicy</strong> put a little more social game into his confessionals, where he made a Hokkigai modpack in Minecraft for trust rankings. <strong>Slaytan</strong> took a backseat in the tribe compared to the last cycle, feeling confident in taking the day off after the challenge win, and secured a UTR rating.

The <strong>Apes</strong> alliance of <strong>Annie, Etay, &amp; PBJ</strong> continues to be the focal point of the tribe. <strong>PBJ</strong> was chosen to go to <em><strong>The Tank</strong></em> for this episode alongside <strong>Kyran</strong> from Sake, but was unable to make any real progress on the challenge held within the &quot;hard&quot; path they chose. While she was away, things were mostly quiet on the tribe, but <strong>Etay</strong> had some endearing vulnerability about mental health and his struggles within his confessional. <strong>PBJ &amp; Etay</strong> both found it prudent to try and further their relationship with <strong>Fones</strong> for future maneuverability, but <strong>Stephen</strong> still finds himself on the outside looking in when it comes to survivability if they were to go to tribal. Fortunately for everyone on Unagi, <strong>Annie &amp; Etay</strong> took first and second place respectively in the immunity challenge, making them the only tribe with a fully in-tact 5 members. <strong>PBJ&#39;s</strong> erratic trip to the tank earned her an OTT, while <strong>Etay</strong> got a complex-positive rating for his confessionals.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099835373393281145 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099835373393281145><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 23, 2023 7:13 PM">7:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099835454079127594 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099835454079127594><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 23, 2023 7:13 PM">7:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>Ebi:</strong></em> <img

Although they put in a lot of effort practicing, the Ebi tribe failed to make an appearance in the finals of the coup-nament and were once again finding themselves at tribal council. The main alliance <strong>Slay-Ebiday</strong> consisting of<strong> Mana, Treb and Sky</strong> sought to target the remaining player on the outs, <strong>Noah</strong>. Although <strong>Noah</strong> tried a little to get some votes onto <strong>Mana</strong>, it was quickly apparent that he wasn&#39;t going to be successful. His tribemates did however really enjoy <strong>Noah</strong> and had only positive things to say about him, and while they were regretful for having to do so, they sent <strong>Noah</strong> home in a 3-1 vote. <strong>Mana, Treb and Noah</strong> all get P tones this episode, <strong>Mana and Treb</strong> for their effort in the challenge, conversations and perceptions regarding their tribemates and <strong>Noah</strong> for the positive feelings his tribe had for him and their sadness in having to send him home. <strong>Mana and Treb</strong> also get CPs for their strategic thoughts and for all but solidifying themselves as a F2 pair, planning on voting out <strong>Sky</strong> if they had to go to tribal again.

<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em> 

This episode we see a little bit of a change! <strong>Treb</strong> stays right at the top, his positioning on the tribe (both with the three person alliance, and his incredibly close duo with Mana) is great and he has lots of tools for success heading into the future. The biggest thing that sets Treb and Mana apart right now is the worry about Mana’s newbie mindset causing them to make some beginner’s mistakes that could cost her the game. But she’s hot on the heels of contenders, that’s for sure! <strong>Jenna</strong> rises up in the rankings. Being able to solidify strong enough bonds with her tribe to sus out some early instances of word twisting benefitted her greatly - And it sets her up wonderfully, having a (now solidified) duo with Pickles. Her confessionals also prove her game awareness and forward thinking!

<strong>PBJ</strong> takes on third place! They had multiple alliances set up, and some great game sense - They’re really good at getting a good read on things and even when it turns into paranoia, she can lean into it and make it work for her - Unlike Etay, who might let it take him over. She’s in the best spot on her tribe and was playing super cleanly, while also understanding that she could willingly dump their tribe come swap. <strong>Annie</strong> similarly, is playing very well - Will not get targeted before the rest of his tribe and could very well sail to merge, he’s done a great job setting up roots here. Only time will tell if they hold up!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099835547385606336 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099835547385606336><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 23, 2023 7:13 PM">7:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099835581040705618 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099835581040705618><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 23, 2023 7:13 PM">7:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ani had a huge week of being incredibly helpful but also a little hater by praising Snackbot, earning them a CPN. Fish, also a known little hater, continues his evil reign but he and Sappho (me that&#39;s me) are in a weird on again off again thing but are constantly in love even if we don&#39;t admit it so we both get OTTMs for being messy in the group chat. You know who wasn&#39;t messy in the group chat? Cheese and Mai, who have a new dance routine that they learned togehter, but DID NOT invite the rest of prod to their recital so MORN i hate them. To counteract them, Ian and Gocubs <em>also</em> leanred a dance routine but invited everyone, so they get an OTTP. Mamo is a piece of dookie who abuses the soundboard. INVN. Dino is now entering his Batman arc, aiming to combat Snackbot (who JPEGed my wife) much to the uproarous applause of the Hungry Specs. Snackbot keeps its OTTNNN for not being able to keep its JPEG to itself, Dino and Specs both get OTTPNs, because we all know its just a slippery slope for the both of them.

<em><strong>Sake:</strong></em>
Sake tribe had another interesting episode with a lot of moving parts. While they were not alone in failing to solve the cipher challenge, their standing in the tiebreaker was not enough to keep them safe from tribal council, which they would have to face for the second time in a row. The Winley boot in the previous episode came and went without seeing any alliance channels formed, so the social dynamics of Sake appeared once more to be in a more fluid state. In the immediate aftermath of the challenge attempt, <strong>Kyran</strong> and <strong>Zacharie</strong> remained in VC and solidified their intentions to work together.  Their target for the vote was <strong>Pickles</strong>, but given the close connection between Pickles and <strong>Jenna</strong>, this would soon be put to the test. With the numbers being so small, <strong>Jenna</strong> was approached with the idea of voting out <strong>Pickles</strong> in order to avoid rocks, but she did not view this move as being in her best interest, and informed Pickles that their name was out. Faced with this information, <strong>Pickles</strong> began to work overtime to shift the target, feeling out both <strong>Kyran</strong> and <strong>Zacharie</strong> too see if one would flip on the other. Without much pressure at all, <strong>Kyran</strong> went to <strong>Jenna</strong> and expressed a willingness to vote out <strong>Zacharie</strong>, an opening that was quickly seized upon. <strong>Zacharie</strong> ultimately ended up flipping as well, and voting <strong>Kyran</strong>, and the other two, now in a swing position, mused about who was the better target, but there was ultimately not enough time to solidify a <strong>Kyran</strong> vote, and <strong>Zacharie</strong> was eliminated in 16th place. 

This cycle saw every member of Sake tribe earn a CP rating, as everyone played a crucial role in this vote with the numbers being so small. <strong>Jenna</strong> got the highest visibility for being the most central figure in determining the outcome, while <strong>Kyran</strong> and <strong>Zacharie</strong> also received a mixed tone for being perceived as less reliable allies moving forward.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 9:54 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101688769020702740 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101688769020702740><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 9:57 PM">9:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>Hokkigai:</strong></em>
The Hokkigai tribe has been a notably quieter and slower tribe compared to the others and as a result not much of note happened for them this episode. They were seemingly going to flop in the challenge which would have shaken some things up, but narrowly secured victory in the final moments thanks to <strong>Rob</strong> (earning him an OTTP rating once again). <strong>Aura</strong> did get to visit <em><strong>The Tank</strong></em>, earning her a CP for her work on that and cross tribe discussion, but ultimately she was unable to walk away with any advantages. This leaves <strong>Dicy</strong> and <strong>Slaytan</strong>, who both get a MOR for mostly just vibing throughout the episode. In Hokkigai’s defense, there wasn’t much that needed to happen, so the relaxed attitude and gameplay is very reasonable.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 9:57 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101689687602634823 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101689687602634823><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:01 PM">10:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>Ebi:</strong></em>
The Ebi tribe was a big focus this episode, largely for them being down to 3 members will everyone else had 4 or 5. This became even more important when it was clear they were not going to win the challenge. A good majority of this episode for Ebi was struggling with the challenge and the impending doom of a 3-person tribal council. That is what earns <strong>Mana</strong> and <strong>Treb</strong> their OTT ratings, as the actual discussion for tribal was minimal, they were all in on the challenge. 

<strong>Sky</strong> gets a MOR for being less involved in the challenge and generally not very present for the tribal. However, every member of Ebi earned a P tone this episode for their perseverance through adversity. This was a tough challenge for them, and an even tougher spot for such a small tribe. But they pushed through and all accepted it was do or die time. While they ultimately did not do it, the tribe kept their heads held high and set their sights on what was to come.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:01 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With yet another great challenge performance the Unagi tribe was once again able to avoid tribal. Even though they didn&#39;t have to worry about tribal, there was still some decent development for the tribe. <strong>Etay</strong> was very assertive about potential alliances and positioning for the upcoming swap, often worrying a bit too deeply about how he was perceived by others. <strong>PBJ</strong> was on a similar wavelength as well, still closely working with Etay, but wary of the future. They created a decoy alliance with <strong>Stephen</strong> for some extra security, while <strong>Stephen</strong> continues to mostly coast through the game. <strong>Annie</strong> is also actively a part of the conversations with Etay and PBJ, but sat back a bit more this cycle compared to the other two. Lastly, <strong>Fones</strong> still plays a very passive game and lets another immunity be an easy way to survive.

<strong>Etay</strong> and <strong>PBJ</strong> both earn CPs this episode for constantly and consistently trying to make sure they are perceived and positioned well for the later stages of the game. <strong>Stephen</strong> and <strong>Annie</strong> both get MORs this episode for taking part in active social and strategy but not actually doing anything complex. <strong>Fones</strong> nets a UTR for becoming dormant once again after securing immunity.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:16 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101693518914793542 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101693518914793542><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:16 PM">10:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Jenna</strong> rises up to the #1 contender spot this episode as it is possible for Treb to get swap-screwed or targeted as a solo player in the upcoming swap. Jenna’s strong gameplay on the Sake tribe helped save their number one ally Pickles from elimination, and they continue to have good reads and gamesense without forming a target on her back. 

<strong>Treb</strong> falls to the second spot since he may have a tricky swap ahead of him, but he is a strong enough player to still be considered for contenders even with that in mind. He dominated the Ebi tribe and was able to walk away from a massacre seemingly unscathed and with a tight and loyal ally in Mana. His strong gameplay and versatility makes it seem likely that Treb will be able to make merge even if he does get a bit screwed by the swap, but his target may balloon as a result.

<strong>Pickles</strong> jumps onto contenders for Episode 3 as she along with Jenna have shown great game sense and social thus far are both well situated for the upcoming swap. Pickles only falls below Jenna as she was targeted over Jenna by her original tribemates for having a less strong social game than Jenna, but not by much. It’s very likely that Pickles and Jenna will be a strong duo that could go very far in this game.

<strong>Dicy</strong> rejoins contenders in our 4th position as he has made the most out of a tribe that didn’t have much to give socially or strategically. Like the other contenders, his game sense has been very strong and he is well positioned going into the merge, but his allies are night as tight or reliable as the other contenders, and his threat level is already starting to show itself which may become a problem down the road.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just like last time the trust on Sake is possibly the most interesting and dynamic thing to look at right now. Every single player is someone’s number one in the game with what seems to be two duos forming with Jenna and Pickles then Kyran and Zacharie. Jenna and Kyran are both tied for the highest trust on the tribe being either someone&#39;s most trusted player or second most trusted player. Zacharie and Pickles are then tied for last being either the most trusted to someone or the least trusted. This tribe will come down to which duo folds first to avoid a rock situation and there is a lot of ways this can play out.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101695553802358834 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101695553802358834><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:24 PM">10:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101695553487781889/be49f774afed897483086e244e3407dd.png?ex=65615af0&amp;is=654ee5f0&amp;hm=1d294083bced49b6af752113271c128b454b43a6877a5884be73f09fc4f4aa58&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101695553487781889/be49f774afed897483086e244e3407dd.png?ex=65615af0&amp;is=654ee5f0&amp;hm=1d294083bced49b6af752113271c128b454b43a6877a5884be73f09fc4f4aa58&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: be49f774afed897483086e244e3407dd.png (156.35 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101695610224132096 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101695610224132096><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:25 PM">10:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Hokkigai:</strong>

Congrats to Dicy for getting first in trust from everyone on his tribe. He can work with anyone he pleases on this tribe and should be in good standing for a while. Rob and Slayton have swapped places as Rob is now in second while Slaytan is in third. How they are perceived are very different however as Rob is second as the second most trusted player by everyone while Slayton is Dicy’s number one and everyone else&#39;s number 3 so they are both pretty equally safe. Sadly Aura still lags behind everyone else not really shifting much in a positive direction compared to last time.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101695750217404497 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101695750217404497><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:25 PM">10:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101695750347432016/6281071eb23ac564be5f624f5177d6af.png?ex=65615b1f&amp;is=654ee61f&amp;hm=b37e1c312196557487849925a7e35c63ae327d2a037533a4d23e9cc210d1c756&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101695750347432016/6281071eb23ac564be5f624f5177d6af.png?ex=65615b1f&amp;is=654ee61f&amp;hm=b37e1c312196557487849925a7e35c63ae327d2a037533a4d23e9cc210d1c756&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 6281071eb23ac564be5f624f5177d6af.png (159 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101695822699188275 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101695822699188275><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:25 PM">10:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Ebi:</strong>

As a tribe of 3 people there is not a whole lot to take note of for trust this time around. Treb has taken over as first place for trust after being rated first from both Mana and Sky. Mana is behind Treb due to Receiving his first place in trust and second from Sky. Sky then rounds it out being second for both Treb and Mana. Due to the nature of this small tribe it is very likely this is all very arbitrary as none of them distrust each other.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101695899819835483 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101695899819835483><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:26 PM">10:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101695899614318653/b0ba8b6a8d7cb1b5aafab40a3f12c61a.png?ex=65615b42&amp;is=654ee642&amp;hm=72554252560e5b136f7836cd45ed68e322de152cdc8530033bc1532faf4f60c7&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101695899614318653/b0ba8b6a8d7cb1b5aafab40a3f12c61a.png?ex=65615b42&amp;is=654ee642&amp;hm=72554252560e5b136f7836cd45ed68e322de152cdc8530033bc1532faf4f60c7&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: b0ba8b6a8d7cb1b5aafab40a3f12c61a.png (161.64 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101695951955046410 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101695951955046410><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 10:26 PM">10:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Unagi:</strong>

Unagi has seen very little change compared to last time, in fact the only player to change their rankings in any way was Stephen who now has Annie as his least trusted and everyone else moving up one. This one shift moved PBJ to have the second highest trust on the tribe and Annie having the third most. Etay is still comfortably in first on the tribe and there is a very clear top three of the tribe and bottom two of the tribe with Fones and Stephen still being at the bottom who may be hoping for a swap soon to help change their positioning.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Uramaki:</strong>
The Uramaki tribe had a relatively quiet start coming into the swap as most of the tribe members felt fairly comfortable with their groupings. From Hokkigai there was the trio of <strong>Dicy, Aura and Slaytan</strong> while from Unagi there was <strong>Etay, Fones and Stephen</strong>. That left <strong>Mana</strong> as the sole Ebi tribe member and only solo on the tribe. A bit unexpectedly, neither group sought out to scoop up <strong>Mana</strong> for a majority, but rather looked to form bonds with the opposing larger group in hopes to make some strong alliances come the merge. The two key players at the top of the tribe are <strong>Dicy and Etay</strong> who quickly bonded and formed the <strong>Cuties Please</strong> alliance consisting of <strong>Dicy, Etay, Fones and Slaytan</strong>. Coming into the challenge the pairings of <strong>Aura, Slaytan and Mana</strong> worked together to diffuse the first bomb, while <strong>Dicy and Etay</strong> worked to diffuse the second. Things were looking a little <em>dicy</em> for both groups in the challenge, however they both managed to diffuse the bombs, securing immunity for the cycle.

<strong>Dicy</strong> and <strong>Etay</strong> earn CPs for being the key players in the formation of the <strong>Cuties Please</strong> alliance and for taking control of the tribe in a quiet but efficient manner. Mana, Aura and Slaytan get MORs for taking part in some good conversation and building trust with their tribemates, but otherwise stuck to the status quo. Stephen and Fones were relatively UTR this cycle outside of some initial odd comments by Stephen at the start of the cycle, but most people either ignored or brushed off the things he was saying.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 2:32 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101718864275984384 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101718864275984384><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 11:57 PM">11:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>Maki:</strong>
The warm atmosphere at Maki’s first meeting is partially the result of a healthy mix of new faces from different tribes. The largest group that arrived together were the final three members of Sake, <strong>Jenna</strong>, <strong>Pickles</strong>, and <strong>Kyran</strong>. The only pair were <strong>Annie</strong> and <strong>PBJ</strong> from Unagi, with the remaining <strong>Treb</strong> from Ebi and <strong>Rob</strong> from Hokkigai arriving alone. Despite Annie and Jenna making quick work of the first bomb, disarming it faster than anyone in the challenge, Treb and Pbj exploded sending Maki to the first tribal council of the swap. Battle lines were quickly drawn up after the challenge, with <strong>Treb</strong>, <strong>Annie</strong>, <strong>Rob</strong>, and <strong>PBJ</strong> forming the <strong>TARP</strong> alliance. With the safety of numbers, Annie suggested a move on Kyran as the weak link among the Sake group and Treb set out to make the pitch to Jenna and Pickles. To make that happen, <strong>Treb</strong>, <strong>Jenna</strong>, and <strong>Pickles</strong> set up the <strong>Arsonists Anonymous</strong> alliance, making Kyran the only tribe member not in any alliance chat at the first vote and the first member of Maki to be voted out. 

<strong>Annie</strong> and <strong>Treb</strong> earn CPs this episode for taking control and operating effectively to pull off a unanimous first vote on the new swap tribe; <strong>Jenna</strong> earns her CP this episode for her careful management of any issues with the plan at the vote by managing Rob’s concern at Kyran writing his name down. <strong>Rob</strong>, <strong>PBJ</strong>, and <strong>Pickles</strong> were happy to let a vote that they weren’t targeted at roll by quietly, netting them MOR ratings. <strong>Kyran</strong> meanwhile wasn’t able to navigate this cycle in terms of making connections, and takes home a MOR rating.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 9, 2023 10:05 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101719127464366150 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101719127464366150><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 11:58 PM">11:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Treb</strong> moves back up to the #1 spot as he was able to quickly but quietly form strong bonds with all of his tribemates and become a key player in the two main alliances on the Maki tribe. He was also able to push a Kyran vote which helped retain his positioning as a middle player without alarming or upsetting either group. Playing the middle can be a dangerous game but Treb is doing a great job doing so without making any waves thus far.

<strong>Jenna</strong> falls to the #2 contenders spot this episode solely as a result of Treb moving up. Jenna was willing to give up Kyran to solidify her alliance with Pickles and Treb and find some solid footing on the Maki tribe. Even if they do go to tribal again it is incredibly unlikely that Jenna or Pickles names will be brought up, however if they lose all three challenges things could get a bit dicey.

<strong>Dicy</strong> moves up to the third contender spot as he has formed multiple alliances and is at the center of the tribe and no one wants to target him. While going to tribal may mean he will have to make a difficult decision, he will still stay in power for the swap and is seemingly locked for merge. However, his threat level is slowly building and it seems that if he is not careful he could get targeted for it mid to late merge.

<strong>Pickles</strong> falls to the fourth spot as like the others they are in a strong position currently, but it seems that if things were to go south on the Maki tribe and they have to go to all three tribals, there is a world where Pickles and Jenna would become the targets and it seems that Pickles may become the target over Jenna solely from not having as strong relationships with the tribe as Jenna does, but should the two of them make merge they will likely be a very strong duo.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Getting to swap can sometimes be a time to renew yourself and change your game, but for other people nothing may change at all and that continues with Dicy who still continues to dominate the trust rankings having the highest average by far among anyone in the game still with 4 people seeing him as their number one. Right behind Dicy also continuing where they left off is Etay who has respectable scores from everyone being right in the 2-3 range. Right in the middle we have Slaytan who is usually seen in good regards and Aura who has had a bump up compared to their starting tribe. Fones is next, who has a bit of a wild set up of trust rankings being seen as Etay’s most trusted and being near the back of the pack for everyone else so his future could be an interesting one to see. Sadly Mana has fallen a bit compared to their starting tribe and unless they make some new connections may be in jeopardy soon. And lastly we still have Stephen who is still seen as the least trustworthy person in the game, Aura did put them as second most trusted so there has been some positive news!!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101734256843173979 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101734256843173979><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 12:58 AM">12:58 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101734256658628629/e1b235f1cf085e7a4c5dccc868f93245.png?ex=65617efc&amp;is=654f09fc&amp;hm=4b0661ecbe60d325af663b86e8497d744c0800559f05dd7558b70c28b23db221&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1101734256658628629/e1b235f1cf085e7a4c5dccc868f93245.png?ex=65617efc&amp;is=654f09fc&amp;hm=4b0661ecbe60d325af663b86e8497d744c0800559f05dd7558b70c28b23db221&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: e1b235f1cf085e7a4c5dccc868f93245.png (84.99 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101734343728173056 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101734343728173056><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 12:58 AM">12:58 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>MAKI:</strong>
The trust ranking on Maki is quite the tale as most of the people on this tribe have very similar scores in trust. In first however we have PBJ who is in a pretty comfortable position. They have the most first place rankings on this tribe with the lone poor score coming from Jenna. Right after that is the cluster of Jenna Treb and Annie who all scored extremely similarly. Jenna is a bit more of a wildcard of the three having lows and highs while Annie and Treb are more consistently “good”. Not far behind this cluster is Pickles who is still seen as a pretty trustworthy individual but just falls a tad behind the others due the the higher amount of back of the back trusts. Rob and Kyran both fall pretty far behind the rest of this tribe being seen as the least trusted or second least trusted from almost everybody. Unless there is a big dynamic shift of the tribe these two should be very easy targets for the rest of the tribe to settle on.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Uramaki:</strong>
The Uramaki tribe was looking unstoppable coming off their second immunity in a row, and <strong>Etay</strong> and <strong>Fones</strong>’s fifth consecutive immunity. After a hot start, the tribe almost got stuck in a crucially close challenge. However, Etay was able to take the reins and secure a narrow victory over Maki with a heroic puzzling effort. It seems that Etay has built himself quite a reputation with his strong performance in challenges, which may be dangerous for his game later. 

Back at camp, talks were light and most took the challenge win as an opportunity to rest, always a luxury in this game. But <strong>Dicy</strong> and <strong>Etay</strong> took that rest day as an opportunity to strategize, strengthening their connection and earning them both CPs for the episode. Even with good positioning in the game and strong connections throughout every tribe he’s been a part of, Etay’s wide ranging confessional paranoia as well as juggling the <strong>Cuties Please</strong> and <strong>NodNod</strong> alliances gets him a Mixed rating. For the rest of the tribe, the day off was a simple proposition, as <strong>Aura</strong>, <strong>Slayton</strong>, <strong>Mana</strong>, <strong>Fones</strong>, and <strong>Stephen</strong> all earn MOR ratings for relying on their bonds and resting after the challenge.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 9:16 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103490581327515698 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103490581327515698><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 9:17 PM">9:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>Maki:</strong>
In the closest challenge of the season, Maki just barely misses out on immunity and has to go back to tribal council. During the challenge, <strong>Jenna</strong> and <strong>Pickles</strong> were eager to get started, while <strong>PBJ</strong> and <strong>Treb</strong> wanted to wait for more of the tribe to be available. Ultimately, they started early and pushed through the challenge with only 4 people. This contributes to all 4 of <strong>Pickles</strong>, <strong>Jenna</strong>, <strong>Treb</strong>, and <strong>PBJ</strong> getting a CP rating this episode. Being the main group who completed the challenge and then strategized about the vote afterwards had them more involved compared to the other tribe members. 

<strong>Treb</strong> and <strong>PBJ</strong> get M tones for their reaction to the challenge, <strong>PBJ</strong> upset at wasting so much time on a red herring puzzle and <strong>Treb</strong> who is still disappointed he cannot win immunity. They also got some bitter final words from <strong>Rob</strong>, who was not happy about being practically ghosted after supposedly having a solid alliance with <strong>Treb</strong>, <strong>PBJ</strong>, and <strong>Annie</strong>. This gets <strong>Rob</strong> an OTTN for not really being part of the vote, but having a big reaction to the ultimate result. <strong>Annie</strong> had the biggest reaction to these final words, but overall was not very involved in much else that happened this cycle which lands them a MOR.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103490687560847452 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103490687560847452><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 9:18 PM">9:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

<strong>Dicy</strong> moves up to the #1 spot this episode mainly as a result of Treb and Jenna falling ever so slightly. Dicy has continued to have a strong grip on the game on every tribe he has been on, but is managing to keep a relatively low profile. Even if Uramaki goes to tribal next episode there is no chance he gets targeted and is a lock for merge, and likely will make a deep run unless something catastrophic happens. 

<strong>Treb</strong> falls to the #2 contenders spot this episode as a result of Rob outing his middling gameplay to the entire tribe, however he is still the crucial swing vote for the next tribal even if some of his deception is coming to light. As long as Treb manages to handle the blow back from Rob well, he should be in a great spot come merge as he can essentially continue his middling position but also regain an ally in Mana and those two can cement themselves with almost any alliance.

<strong>Jenna</strong> drops to the #3 contenders spot solely due to the fact that if Maki loses another challenge there could be some murky roads ahead for them. While Jenna will most likely not be the target, any Maki vote will likely create an even deeper divide amongst the tribe and could leave Jenna a bit vulnerable come merge. However, if Maki manages to avoid tribal council, Jenna and Pickles should find themselves in a bit of a swing position come the merge.

<strong>PBJ</strong> rises back onto the contenders this episode as she, like Jenna, seems to be in a strong spot on the Maki tribe and potentially will be in a strong position going into the merge. PBJ would likely be able to stay over Annie in the case of Maki losing again and Treb working with Pickles and Jenna, but unlike Pickles and Jenna will have some allies from Unagi come the merge. However, those numbers, along with some unfortunate paranoia, could also land PBJ in a bit of hot water sooner rather than later, but PBJ is experienced enough to maneuver out of some tricky situations.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Uramaki:</strong>
Uramaki narrowly loses the challenge, and while there were some mixed performances, the blame is mostly targeted at <strong>Stephen</strong> who DNF’d which added enough time to net Maki the victory. While the tribe was initially a bit divided on who to target, after seeing <strong>Stephen’s</strong> DNF the majority decided it would be best to target <strong>Stephen</strong> and form a strong alliance for the upcoming merge. <strong>Dicy, Etay, Mana, Fones and Slaytan</strong> decided to split the votes three on <strong>Stephen</strong> and two on <strong>Aura</strong> in case <strong>Stephen</strong> or <strong>Aura</strong> had an advantage from the tank. <strong>Aura</strong> is set to target <strong>Fones</strong> after discussing with her allies who were planning on blindsiding her. Ultimately the vote ends up being a 4-2-1 on <strong>Stephen</strong>, <strong>Aura</strong> and <strong>Fones</strong> respectively since <strong>Stephen</strong> self-voted. But if we just ignore that silly little detail then it’s really more like a 3-2-1 which is <strong>Dicy’s</strong> favorite. Upon seeing the results of the vote, <strong>Aura</strong> immediately blows up in all of her alliance chats for being shams and for blindsiding her, but <strong>Dicy and Etay</strong> do a relatively good job at damage control.

<strong>Dicy, Etay and Mana</strong> all get CPs for their strategizing this episode, with an extra nod to <strong>Etay and Dicy</strong> for their strong damage control with <strong>Aura</strong> after the blindside.  <strong>Fones and Slaytan</strong>, while included in the plans, took a back seat strategically and socially this episode, but still played an important part in the vote. <strong>Aura</strong> gets an OTTN for the blowup at tribal and some of the proceeding conversations. <strong>Stephen</strong> gets an INV for being absent most of the episode, but also an N tone for the negative perception from the tribe after causing the loss in the challenge.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103501368016257024 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103501368016257024><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 10:00 PM">10:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<strong>Maki:</strong>
After an incredibly close challenge, Maki was finally able to avoid tribal council, thus preventing <strong>Treb</strong> from going to every single tribal pre-merge! Following their win, for the most part the players took a well deserved break and chatted about the potential merge on the horizon. <strong>Treb</strong> however did set out to clear the air a bit after <strong>Rob</strong> outed his alliance to the entire tribe, revealing that he was playing the middle. <strong>Pickles</strong> in particular pushed <strong>Treb</strong> for information trying to suss out where exactly he stood with her and <strong>Jenna</strong> and got some good reassurances.

<strong>Treb</strong> and <strong>Pickles</strong> both earn CPs this episode, <strong>Treb</strong> for trying to do some major damage control and prepare for the merge, and <strong>Pickles</strong> for her conversation with <strong>Treb</strong> and attempting to clear the air and set herself up the best she can before the merge.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103501423288778803 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103501423288778803><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 10:00 PM">10:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Dicy</strong> retains his #1 position this episode as he navigated the entirety of the vote this episode with ease and did an incredible job at managing his relationships, especially with Aura who was blindsided. The vote solidified his alliances coming into merge, yet his threat level is still quite under wraps compared to some other players. If he continues this gameplay style he should be able to coast through the early merge and find himself near the endgame before things start getting even a little bit <em>dicey</em>

<strong>Treb</strong> stays in the #2 position this episode as he finally manages to avoid tribal and also did a decent job managing his relationships after the Rob fallout. Coming into the merge he will be in a very strong swing position and will be able to utilize the connections Mana made with the other side. As long as no other blowups or complications happen Treb should be in a very secure position for a while.

<strong>Jenna</strong> also retains her position on the contenders list in position #3 this episode as she too, like Treb, avoided tribal and thus avoided a situation that could have been very messy for the Makis. Since Jenna and Pickles are the only two remaining Sakes they also find themselves in a bit of a swing position, however they don’t have the same connections to the Uramakis that Treb and Mana will.

<strong>Etay</strong> rises up to the #4 position this episode after an incredibly strong showing in the tank and in the vote. Etay found the idol in the tank, giving him a new layer of security and kept that information to himself. When it came time for the vote he also smartly cut his connection with Stephen and took out an Unagi making it so they weren’t so fearsome coming into the merge. However, Etay still is a bit too paranoid for his own good, but if he can keep it under wraps like he did this episode he is likely to make it fairly deep and have a good chance to win should he make it to FTC.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 10:00 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Uramaki has not seen a ton of shifts since last time which is to be expected when there has yet to be a tribal for them. Still in first we have Dicy who continues to dominate trust this season being in the top three trust of every player and first by the majority of the time. Etay also is still doing very well being second in trust with the only real fault being a low score from Mana. Slaytan still continues to be right in the middle having good to average scores from everyone. And Fones continues being a wild ride of trust who sees a wide variety of scores from being top 2 to some people and the least trusted to others. Mana has done a tiny bit of work compared to last time being trusted slightly more but is still near the back of the pack. Aura has taken the biggest fall now being in the bottom two of the tribe only being trusted by Stephen. And still in last we have Stephen who continues to have next to no one trusting him with only Aura putting him above 6th place.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103506634552135782 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103506634552135782><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 10:21 PM">10:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1103506634250125404/36dedf23d74d6a85b1d4dcd07481cdd6.png?ex=655eb723&amp;is=654c4223&amp;hm=96a6ef796ac7985db7d2cc0b3e574a986d9eb57e0945a498f74e735f89ff84d2&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1103506634250125404/36dedf23d74d6a85b1d4dcd07481cdd6.png?ex=655eb723&amp;is=654c4223&amp;hm=96a6ef796ac7985db7d2cc0b3e574a986d9eb57e0945a498f74e735f89ff84d2&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 36dedf23d74d6a85b1d4dcd07481cdd6.png (149.82 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103506685571633303 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103506685571633303><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 10:21 PM">10:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>MAKI:</strong>

Since the last time we looked at Maki trust rankings the two people who were at the bottom of trust were voted out so now all that remains was the bunch of players that were all similar in score. And as we look at trust today, that still remains true for that bunch of players as everyone on this tribe scored within 1 of each other. Up first is still PBJ who is the only player to be the number 1 for multiple people and also the only player to not be tied with another player putting them alone in first. Pickles has moved up in the group from being the least trusted of the bunch to being tied for the second most trusted long side Treb who is very much in the middle of all these players. Then in last we have Annie and Jenna but despite being last, they still are very trusted by some players both being another player&#39;s number one. In fact Treb is the only player on this tribe who is not someone&#39;s number one or someone&#39;s number four.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But it wasn’t all snacks and feasts, as the merge challenge saw a blend of social, creative, and individual strength skills in a sushi dating game! Ultimately <strong>Mana </strong>was victorious, proving their versatility in the critical areas of this game. The largest alliance at the merge was <strong>Honestly Yes</strong> featuring <strong>Annie, Dicy, Etay, Mana, PBJ, and Treb</strong>, with a collection of smaller alliances formed to scope out potential partners at the merge. It was this alliance however where critical strategy took place, and where <strong>Fones</strong>’ name first came up. 

<strong>Fones </strong>had been talking strategy with <strong>PBJ </strong>about <strong>Dicy and Etay</strong>, who <strong>Fones</strong>identified as social threats moving forward, but only after naming <strong>Aura </strong>as his desired vote for writing his name down. <strong>PBJ </strong>and <strong>Annie </strong>discussed <strong>Fones</strong>’ penchant for letting names slip, with <strong>Annie </strong>eventually telling the <strong>Honestly Yes</strong> alliance that <strong>Fones </strong>had said 4 names soon after the end of the challenge. This messy situation netted <strong>Annie </strong>a CP with a Negative tone and <strong>PBJ </strong>a CP Mixed for their leaky and somewhat embellished version of the story. However, the move was effective and <strong>Fones </strong>was made the first member of the jury with an OTT Mixed rating. Meanwhile, <strong>Treb’s </strong>paranoia caused him to disconnect from his closest allies like <strong>Mana</strong>, beginning to consider them threats to his game and shrinking the mobility of his game which earned him an OTT with a Mixed tone. <strong>Dicy </strong>and <strong>Etay </strong>were in lockstep, making the decision to ditch <strong>Fones </strong>together and keeping each other comfortably at first in trust. This earned <strong>Dicy </strong>a CP, while <strong>Etay’s </strong>closeness to the vote and suspicions of his allies intentions earned him a CP Mixed. <strong>Slayton, Pickles, and Jenna</strong> were left behind by the voting bloc and hoped they were safe, earning them MOR ratings. <strong>Aura </strong>was still feeling the results of her upset response to being left out at the last vote by being left out again, earning her an MOR rating with a Mixed tone.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, May 8, 2023 10:42 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105323853628055552 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105323853628055552><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 8, 2023 10:42 PM">10:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

<strong>Treb</strong> rises up to the #1 contender spot coming into the merge as he has managed to form a lot of strong early bonds with some of the players he is meeting for the first time, and still has a strong working relationship with all the players he has met before, especially Mana. While some players are aware of Treb as a potential threat down the road, they are still working with him rather than against him, and while his connections may put a target on his back, they are also likely to save him in a tricky spot. Treb is also a relatively strong challenge performer and if push came to shove he does have potential to go on an immunity run.

<strong>Dicy</strong> falls to the #2 contender spot mainly due to his perception and threat status. While Dicy is a strong player, he was clocked right away by a couple of players as someone to take out sooner rather than later. However, Dicy does have a lot of allies and the skills to pull together a blindside. If Dicy can take out the threats before they take him out, he stands a good chance of making it deep, and if he makes FTC he will have a strong winning case.

<strong>Jenna</strong> retains the #3 contenders spot this episode as she is arguably one of the best positioned players. Jenna has a strong but subtle social game that is perfect for making connections without raising too many eyebrows. She was also able to find, and more importantly keep quiet about, the merge hidden immunity idol. Her ability to bond, strategize, and keep her head down are all valuable traits that will allow Jenna to make it deep, and with a little luck (and maybe an idol play) Jenna should be able to find herself near if not at FTC with relative ease.

<strong>Mana</strong> joins contenders for the first time this episode as she has been playing a fairly strong game with not many drawbacks. Her sociability, drive and challenge strengths have allowed her to make it to the merge without much trouble, but she doesn’t have the same target that the others have. If Mana is able to take out some of the big threats, and possibly separate herself from Treb, she should be able to have a strong case should she make FTC. However, if she winds up there with any of the above players she would likely be a losing finalist, but don’t count her out just yet!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Merge is an exciting time for trust and early merge is one of the most pivotal times to build trust up with people, and one of the masters of trust this season Etay is still flying high with this being first in trust with tons of allies from his original tribe and swap tribe. Right behind him we have Treb who has been particularly good as of late of being near the top of everyone’s trust while not being number one for most people. In third we have one of the highest risers all season in Mana who has skyrocketed to the top. Mana has become a hot ticket item for people for an ally they potentially want and it will be interesting to see how this holds up. Pbj and Dicy follow up next being around the middle of the trust being players that are mostly trusted by their swap tribes but not as much from people they may have just met. Annie and Slaytan are up next, who have fallen a tad compared to where they once were but still are trusted positively by some people which should make them fine for the time being. Jenna and Pickles are next, who are starting to lag behind where they only really trust each other and have not made any close new connections where other people have. Next is Aura who continues to be at the bottom of trust being in the bottom half from almost everyone. Lastly we have Fones who has had a terrible start to merge being ranked last by everyone but two players this merge and will really need to change things up to get out of this potential inescapable  hole that he has fallen into.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>TEMAKI:</strong>
This cycle was a wild ride so buckle up…

Starting off this cycle was the auction, where players could bid on five traditional auction items and five items relating to the f10 challenge. <strong>Etay, Aura, Mana, and Slaytan</strong> all immediately bid 500 on trays they want with <strong>Aura</strong> going for the only not-game related tray. All of them, sans <strong>Slayton</strong>, get OTTs for that, and for future things in the cycle. The immediate maxing of bids greatly upset <strong>PBJ</strong>, who publicly picked a fight about it in tribe chat berating them for being selfish and not agreeing to work with anyone else on it. This (and many other instances this cycle) nets her an OTT, and an N tone for managing to drive a rift between her and nearly half the tribe. 

<strong>Mana</strong> went out of their way to try and patch things up with <strong>PBJ</strong> in a private conversation, to which the two of them both apologized and moved on. Unfortunately, <strong>Treb</strong> was under the impression that these two were beefing still, and decided to leak his conversations to both <strong>PBJ and Mana</strong> individually, telling both of them that the other is mad, at one point even explicitly telling <strong>PBJ</strong> that <strong>Mana</strong> is a huge threat and the two of them need to deal with them sooner rather than later. This earns him an OTT for his unnecessary leaks and misinformation spreading, and an N tone for throwing <strong>Mana</strong>, who still keeps him as their #1, under the bus for no reason. 

The auction finishes without much more fuss and the players who have been scheming through it are able to enact their thoughts. <strong>Dicy</strong> sends himself to the tank, <strong>Treb</strong> gave himself the emoji curse for next cycle, <strong>PBJ</strong> walks out with not one, but two advantages, and <strong>Etay</strong> wins a fake idol kit (which he then immediately tells everyone about, spoiling that it is fake). 

The challenge commences and is much harder than people expect, with only <strong>Annie and Treb</strong> completing it in its entirety, and only <strong>Annie</strong> actually enjoying the challenge. After the challenge commences, <strong>Annie</strong> began spreading talks of breaking up the original tribal duos; in that of <strong>Mana/Treb</strong>, and <strong>Pickles/Jenna</strong>. A <strong>Pickles</strong> vote began to gain some traction, alerting alarm bells to <strong>Treb</strong>, who could see what was happening and who was going to be next in that scenario, who begins planting the seeds to <strong>PBJ, Jenna, and Pickles</strong> about a possible <strong>Dicy</strong> vote; when then spreads further from them to <strong>Annie and Etay</strong>.

With <strong>Treb</strong> winning immunity and <strong>Dicy</strong> returning from the tank empty handed, as he successfully completed the same path <strong>Slaytan</strong> did to find that Slaytan had the advantage, <strong>Dicy</strong> appeared to be the apparent vote from early on. However, with Leaktay in full force, <strong>Etay</strong> informs <strong>Dicy</strong> of this and the two begin to devise how they can salvage this. 

<strong>Slaytan</strong> expertly manages his conversations with <strong>Dicy</strong> about their times in the tank, denying that he has an advantage and instead pinning it on <strong>Kyran</strong>, which <strong>Dicy</strong> seems to accept enough to stop spreading his name and shift to <strong>Annie</strong>, whom he and <strong>Etay</strong> feel like would be an easier vote. This earns <strong>Slaytan</strong> a CP, keeping his advantage hidden and putting himself into a powerful middle position in the tribe. 

From <strong>Dicy&#39;s</strong> perspective <strong>Annie</strong> has been the one spreading everything along with <strong>PBJ</strong>; which culminates in an explosive climax of his last ditch effort to put on a show for the spectators, revealing everything from his perspective on what&#39;s happened this cycle, with <strong>PBJ and Annie</strong> being at the center. This, combined with the mounting frustration from <strong>Etay&#39;s</strong> constant leaking, and their own fatigue from the social game, leads to <strong>Annie</strong> stepping out of the game 30 minutes before votes lock.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105495284865302628 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105495284865302628><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 9, 2023 10:03 AM">10:03 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Jenna</strong> rises up to the #1 contender spot after a particularly messy cycle damaged the reputation of a lot of the other contenders. Jenna was able to avoid the drama and the backlash further strengthening her already strong position on the tribe. If Jenna finds herself in any trouble down the road there are many bonds she can utilize and many chaotic players she can redirect blame to that she should be off the chopping block for a while. 

<strong>Mana</strong> rises up to the #2 contenders spot this episode more as a result of the previous cycle than for any particularly strong gameplay done by Mana themselves. Mana’s game so far has a lot of positives but not a lot of negatives, and while that may not normally earn many votes at FTC, with this cast simply being social and not chaotic might just be enough.

<strong>Treb</strong> falls to the #3 contenders spot simply because his threat level is well known by just about everyone, and while they aren’t currently trying to target him, that day will come sooner rather than later. However, Treb has enough social capital to make some big moves before that day comes, and if he utilizes his bond with Mana, and wins a clutch immunity or two, he will have an incredibly strong story at the end. While a lot of things will need to go right for Treb to make FTC, he is a strong enough player to figure out what those things are and do his best to make it happen.

<strong>Slaytan</strong> joins contenders for the first time in the #4 position after a particularly strong showing this episode amongst all of the chaos. While Slaytan doesn’t have the same bonds as the rest of the contenders, he does have a good strategic mind, stays out of trouble, and an advantage in his pocket that if utilized correctly could earn him a lot of win equity near the end. While he is a bit of a dark horse at the moment, this episode showed that Slaytan is not someone to sleep on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105495578370117804 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105495578370117804><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 9, 2023 10:04 AM">10:04 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@All Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The first instance of power rankings is always an important thing to look out as it gives an idea of who people see as potential threats. In first, which is no real surprise, is Treb who is seen as a top 4 threat by everyone in the game and is far ahead of anyone else. He has connections to pretty much everyone and has had one of the biggest journeys of the game so it will take some real work to avoid being targeted. Right behind Treb we have PBJ who also makes sense being seen as a strong strategic and social player by most of the cast. With their rise in trust also comes a rise in power as Mana comes in third. They have really been given a better game position at merge but perhaps a little too good. After this we have an interesting duo of both Etay and Dicy who are both near the middle of the pact despite their good games up to this point, this may be very good for them as it can help them make it further in the game with good win equity due to other people being seen as bigger threats than them. After this is Pickles who is in a fun spot where they aren’t that trusted but still in decent power positioning, so their upcoming game will be something to really look at. Annie is right behind Pickles where they are in a good spot to potentially make it far. Jenna and Slaytan are next and are in a position where they will really need to pick up the game if they want a chance to win. Lastly is Aura who unfortunately is not really seen in high regard by most of the cast and will need to start gaming it up hardcore for people to change their mind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Dicy’s comments at tribal may have played a part in Annie’s decision to walk, it should be noted that Annie had been struggling with the game up til that point and had considered quitting beforehand. However, many players didn’t have that knowledge and therefore felt that Dicy was solely responsible and mutually agreed that should Dicy not win the next immunity, he would be targeted, and if he did, Etay would be the target instead. Etay, paranoid with his position and feeling responsible for Annie walking himself, tried to find his footing anywhere he could, but his constant scrambling each vote left a lot of his tribemates feeling that he was untrustworthy. 

Pickles was one of the few castaways who Dicy reached out to in an attempt to fix his position that was willing to talk game. While Pickles was clear that they likely would have to vote for Dicy anyways, if he should find a way to save himself she’d work with him in the future. PBJ on the other hand was very negative towards Dicy, and worked to ensure he went home and pushed very aggressively for him to be targeted. Treb this cycle was cursed with only talking with emojis, which actually worked to his benefit as he was able to avoid a lot of tricky conversations regarding the fallout from the previous episode and most people found the conversations he tried to have funny and endearing. Aura talked to Etay after the fallout and told him that she didn’t trust him, but that she was still talking with him because she enjoyed their conversations. Etay took this poorly and felt scorned by Aura, although that was not her intent. Aura was really trying to say that she was willing to work with him still a little bit and give him room to work even though she didn’t fully trust him. Jenna was relatively quiet this episode but had a lot of constructive and productive conversations with others in the aftermath of Annie’s walk from the game as well as had a lot of strategic thoughts on where to go forward in the game and thoughts about when and how to use her idol if necessary.

Etay and PBJ both get OTTNs this cycle, Etay for his scrambling that was perceived negatively by his tribe and PBJ for her negativity towards Dicy and her aggression on the vote. Jenna and Pickles both get CPs this episode for their stellar social management in the midst of a lot of negativity and chaos. Pickles specifically gets a shoutout for great jury management with Dicy, while Jenna gets a shoutout for some great strategic planning and for having a lot of conversations that would help her with plans down the road. Treb gets a P tone this episode for everyone enjoying his emoji curse that he placed upon himself and for seeing him as a funny bright spot in an otherwise relatively negative episode. Aura gets an N tone for their conversation with Etay which led to a feud between herself and Etay for the foreseeable future. Dicy gets an M tone for his apologetic conversations throughout the episode, but also for still being targeted despite his best efforts.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107831561602220163 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107831561602220163><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 8:47 PM">8:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

She was able to keep herself out of all of the drama from the last two episodes while still holding onto her idol, giving her an incredibly strong position to continue her strong UTR social gameplay. As long as Jenna is able to keep her positioning without being seen as a non-entity in the game they are slated to make FTC with a decently strong winning chance.

<strong>Pickles</strong> rises up to the #2 spot this episode for almost all the same reasons as Jenna, except Pickles doesn’t have an idol to bail herself out should push come to shove. However, Pickles is seen as more social than Jenna from a lot of the cast and that may give her the edge at FTC should both Jenna and Pickles make it there together, however at this time it’s still hard to say which two would win if they made it there together.

<strong>Mana</strong> drops to the #3 contenders spot mainly due to the rising threat that Jenna and Pickles as a duo possess and for falling slightly behind in strategy and social due to an incredibly busy work schedule. However, it is still early enough in the game where Mana can make a strong comeback and have a come from behind win since no one seems to be targeting her just yet.

<strong>Treb</strong> has a lot of win equity at this point, but people are beginning to notice, if he does not start to pump the brakes a bit he will get shot sooner than later. However, Treb does have the challenge ability to potentially win out or die trying.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There have been a ton of shifts in trust compared to the start of the merge but one thing is staying true however is Treb being near the top of everyone’s list who is now lapping everyone in trust being the most trusted by far. Right behind him we have Mana who still is rocking the high of the start of merge and continues to be more trusted by people and has completely rebounded from the swap phase of the game. Next we have the combo of Pickles and Jenna who have risen a ton compared to last time and now are two of the most trusted people in the game putting them in possibly the best position of the game. Pbj comes next who has fallen a tad but is still trusted a decent amount by the majority of the cast. Slaytan is still around the same levels of trust as he was at the start of the merge which has been fine so far but may need to pick it up soon otherwise he may be left behind. Next is Aura is similarly still near the back of the back in trust with little improvement. Lastly we have Etay then Dicy who have both taken a huge fall from being two of the most trusted people in the game to two of the least trusted. Mostly due to the consequences of last cycle their time in the game may soon be over.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>TEMAKI:</strong>
This episode started out pretty clean cut, with the whole group pretty quickly settling into the idea for an Etay vote. Especially after all the drama with him and Dicy the past two cycles, it simply made sense to a lot of people. They all gave Etay a fake plan, they were all going to pile their votes on Aura instead. But in a Snackvivor merge, easy is never easy. 

Last minute, Jenna decided to spice things up. She realized that Etay wasn&#39;t incredibly close or trusting with anybody else in the game, and made a small move to preserve part of their relationship for some good ol&#39; jury management. And jury management it was! Jenna didn&#39;t know he had an idol, he kept that on lockdown (just like how she was keeping hers on lockdown) - And it paid off. He played that idol for himself, and sent Aura straight to ponderosa.

Jenna nets a CP for her complex thinking in terms of smart jury management and open mindedness, while Etay gets a CP for his idol play and game awareness. Etay also gets a mixed tone for being a little bit down in the dumps with a good portion of the cast, while pulling off a move that puts his feet back on the metaphorical ground of the game - Plus being in good enough standing with at least one other, relatively powerful, player that could make that happen for him. Pickles also rounds out the notable players this episode, showcasing some great strategy talks in their 1-on-1s in an attempt to save Etay from falling victim to a F8 unanimous vote - She almost gathered enough too, with Slaytan and Jena fully on board - Some great strategy and jury management on their end!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108574401575796828 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108574401575796828><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 9:58 PM">9:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Jenna</strong> retains the number one spot this episode as they have continued their strong UTR positioning and still hold onto an idol. Assuming Treb does not win out, it is likely that there will be the duo of Jenna and Pickles at the end with someone they choose to bring in tow. However, Jenna has not made any big moves thus far and if things don’t change soon it may be hard to distinguish their game from the other finalists.

<strong>Pickles</strong>also retains the number two contenders spot this episode as like Jenna they have been playing a very strong UTR social game. Pickles is more outwardly social then Jenna, and they could easily swap positions at any point. However, Jenna having an idol gives her a slight edge, but if Pickles can cut Jenna or make a move independent of her, then she could easily find herself at the end with a winning story.

<strong>Mana</strong> keeps the third contenders spot this episode as it seems that they will likely make it to FTC based on the current gamestate, but they may have a hard time beating Jenna or Pickles. However, Mana does have a different story than the two of them and if they sell themselves well at FTC they do have a chance of sneaking out a win. There is also a lot of game left to play and if Treb goes soon Mana can step into her own a bit more and make some winning moves.

<strong>Treb</strong> stays at the fourth contenders spot simply because he will win if he can continue winning out, but the moment he loses immunity he will go home. While it isn’t incredibly likely for Treb to win every challenge to the end, he is a gamer and if anyone can do it, it would be Treb.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Unlike trust there has not been a ton of shifts in power compared to last time. Treb is still in first and seen as the biggest threat by almost everyone and there is no signs of this changing any time soon creating a tough road to the end for Treb. Pbj and Mana are still both in the same position being second and third respectively meaning they could be in treacherous waters as well. Pickles and Jenna are next who have seen a bit of a boost just like their trust due to the state of the game currently, they are both in great positions of being pretty trusted and both not the most obvious threats while still having win equity. Slaytan comes next who has not changed much and is going to have a particular FTC or good endgame to boost him up. Just as Etay fell in trust he has also fallen in power not having a ton of people wanting to vote for him to win for a variety of reasons. And lastly we still have Aura who sadly may have a rough future ahead of them with a small chance to win.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Coming off an idol play a lot of players were up in the air on how they wanted the next vote to go. Some still wanted to target Etay, some were worried about Treb constantly winning and that his threat level was getting too high, and others were worried about potential advantages, including the known advantage Slaytan had. 

The F7 challenge was “Fish or No Fish”, a spin on “Deal or no Deal”, which saw Treb winning with a mere 94,012 fish. This nets Treb his third immunity win, guaranteeing his spot at F6 but further increasing his threat level. One thing to note is that Etay was consistently given deals above 100k fish but opted to continue playing in hopes of a better deal but ended up flying too close to the sun and ended up with only 1000 fish. 

With Treb immune, there were three different directions the vote was leaning. Jenna and Pickles wanted to target Mana for being close to Treb, hoping to weaken Treb by taking out his number one ally. Slaytan wanted to target Etay as he was growing in threat level as well, and would likely sweep should he make it to the end. The last target was Slaytan himself, who PBJ was pushing as she knew of his advantage, thinking it was an extra vote when in reality it was a steal-a-vote, and wanted it removed before it could become a problem down the road. 

PBJ warned Treb of Pickles and Jenna’s plan to target Mana, and Treb got Mana on board the Slaytan vote. PBJ also reached out to Etay and got him on board the Slaytan vote as it would buy Etay another day in the game and an ally, if only for a short while. During all of this, Pickles managed to find and solve the idol clue that was hidden after Etay played his idol at F8, giving both Jenna and Pickles idols for the future. 

The final vote was 4-2-1 with Slaytan, Jenna and Pickles being blindsided. PBJ did immediately try to apologize to Jenna and Pickles for the move, but the apology was met with a strongly negative reception from Pickles.

Jenna, Pickles, Treb and PBJ all get CPs for their respective strategizing this episode, each seeking to make a move to strengthen their game. PBJ however gets an N tone for lying to Jenna and Pickles and then attempting to immediately backpedal with an apology, upsetting her former allies. Mana gets a UTR this episode for being relatively unavailable due to work and life commitments, but was still ultimately filled in thanks to her alliance with Treb. Etay gets an OTT this episode for his scrambling immediately after the challenge and for his frantic conversations both in and out of his confessionals. Slaytan gets a MOR for settling on a simple Etay vote, but getting blindsided in the process.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108592345026408569 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108592345026408569><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 11:10 PM">11:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Jenna</strong> once again stays on the top of contenders as she continues to play an incredibly strong UTR game and even after being blindsided was able to keep composure and make the best of a tricky situation. Since Jenna and Pickles both now have idols, it is hard to say which one would be the front runner, but it seems that should the vote flip onto the Jenna and Pickles duo, Pickles would be targeted before Jenna, giving Jenna the slight edge.

<strong>Pickles</strong> also finds herself in the second contenders spot again as she, like Jenna, has been playing a very strong UTR game. Now armed with an idol it’s very likely that Pickles will be able to save herself during a critical vote down the line and make a big move. Jenna and Pickles so far have very similar stories and it&#39;s hard to say which would win at the end, but with Pickles outburst at PBJ and likelihood to get targeted before Jenna, Pickles just barely falls below Jenna for the top contenders spot.

<strong>Treb</strong> rises to the third contenders spot as Mana’s inactivity has begun to be noticed by the jury which could negatively impact her chances at FTC should she make it. Treb is also continuing his immunity streak furthering the idea that he could win out, however it is not likely enough yet to put him any higher on the contenders list, but should he win out he will likely sweep at FTC.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As we have come to expect from trust at this point, we still have Treb in first but the pack is slowly starting to catch up to him. People still trust him a ton and are seen as an ally to almost everyone. Pbj rebounded back to where she once was now, being second in trust after falling for a bit. They are almost on the same level as Treb and are also someone seen as potentially an ally to everyone. Jenna comes next and is where the dynamics shift a little bit where they are clearly seen as trusted a lot by some and not as much by others but are still trusted in a positive way. Mana comes next and has fallen a bit compared to early merge but still around the middle. Pickles has fallen a lot compared to last time being near the bottom, another thing of note this is the first time in awhile Jenna and Pickles were not right next to each other in a trust rankings. Finally in last we have Etay and Slaytan who both continue their recent trends of Etay falling and Slaytan not really making any advances in trust.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 11:13 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Immediately following the previous vote, PBJ was on an apology tour to Jenna and Pickles about blindsiding them. Although Pickles was initially very upset, they agreed to continue working together as it benefitted all of their games to do so and PBJ wanted to salvage any relationship left between them.

The F6 challenge was an ORG classic, a flash game speedrun. Mana was unable to participate due to an incredibly busy work schedule and personal matters to attend to outside of the game. Of the remaining players, it was clear off the bat that immunity would be a battle between Treb and Etay. The two consistently were lowering their times in a fairly tight race, but in the end Treb would pull ahead and squeak out yet another immunity win, the fourth of the season.

It was clear that at this point in the game threats needed to be taken out as soon as possible or one would be likely to find themselves at FTC, and with Treb immune the main two targets were Etay and PBJ. Unfortunately for Etay, there wasn’t much room for him to work as a majority of the tribe wanted him gone as they felt it benefitted their games. Treb wanted him gone due to his threat status and his immunity challenge skills. PBJ felt she needed to cut ties with him and re-align with Jenna and Pickles. Jenna and Pickles needed Etay gone so that Treb would be the last major hurdle in their way. Mana wanted to protect Treb and remove any other major threats to help get the two of them as far as possible in the game.

While all of this was going on, Pickles and Jenna revealed their idols to each other and then worked together to try and find the best way to play them to ensure both players would make it to at least F4. While they had initially considered idoling themselves, they felt confident in their relationships with PBJ and Treb to not need to use them, and Etay was ultimately sent home in a 5 - 1 vote.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108601052263092266 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108601052263092266><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 11:44 PM">11:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Pickles</strong> rises to the number one contenders spot this episode as she has consistently been able to utilize her relationships to ensure her and Jenna’s safety. She rises above Jenna this episode solely because she has been the more visible member of the duo, and it seems incredibly likely for both of them to make FTC at this point. Should they both make FTC, Pickles will likely be rewarded over Jenna as her playstyle and relationships were more on display and her game as a whole will likely be favored just a bit more by the jury.

<strong>Jenna</strong> falls to the number two contenders spot this episode solely due to Pickles moving up. Jenna has played a very strong game thus far, but doesn’t have many moves or relationships that she can claim at FTC that Pickles can’t also claim. If both Jenna and Pickles make it to FTC together, it will likely be a very tight race, and while Jenna can win, it appears that Pickles is favored in that situation.

<strong>Treb</strong> remains at the third contenders spot as he continues his incredible immunity streak, but as mentioned before, the moment he loses an immunity challenge he will be swiftly sent to the jury. Treb’s only hope of not needing an immunity win at this point is if both he and Mana are at F4 together and Mana wants to give him fire, but even that isn’t a guarantee.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108601239119343649 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108601239119343649><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 11:45 PM">11:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

It&#39;s almost a guarantee as soon as Treb is able to be voted out he will be voted out if anyone wants to win. Pbj is still near the top being second so there is some worry for their ability to make it to the end but if they do they will have a great shot to win. The roller coaster of Etay continues who has bounced back to third place in power after being near the top early merge and near the bottom as of late. Etay’s chances of winning if he makes FTC has increased a lot in the last episode but now is back in the territory where it might be hard to make FTC. Pickles is in possibly a very good position as they are next meaning if the three people above them are to be voted out before FTC they would be the player with the highest power giving them possibly the best shot of making FTC and winning.

With Etay gone from the game the next vote seemed relatively simple, if Treb loses immunity then he is voted out, if not it’s either leaning Mana to weaken Treb or PBJ to give Jenna and Pickles the best shot at winning should Treb lose at F4. 

The F5 challenge was a lengthy word ladder that seemed to give each of the players a bit of trouble, except for one. Unfortunately for Treb, even though he would get a perfect score, it was not fast enough to beat Mana who was able to also get a perfect score but doing so about 30 minutes faster. Jenna, Pickles and PBJ all had varying times, but none of them would achieve a perfect score leaving them out of the running. 

With Mana having immunity the writing was on the wall. However, Treb wasn’t ready to go down without a fight. He tried to make a pitch to Jenna and Pickles that PBJ was a bigger threat than himself, and that should he be voted out he would tout PBJ and Mana to the jury over the two of them. While Jenna and Pickles had given the strong-arming from Treb some thought, they ultimately decided that it would be best for their games to take Treb out while they had the chance then to possibly let him make it to FTC. Pickles, fearing that some of Treb’s attempts to save himself might be working, chose to use her idol on PBJ to ensure that Treb would go home no matter what. While PBJ was on board for a Treb vote, Mana would not give up on Treb and refused to vote for him, leading to a vote of 3 - 0 with Treb going home.

Treb gets an OTTM this episode for his aggressive strong-arming of Jenna and Pickles and for his final words that attempted to bolster PBJ and Manas games while also slightly weakening that of Jenna and Pickles. Mana gets a P tone this episode for her optimism and attempts to save Treb even though the writing was on the wall. PBJ gets a CP this episode for having lots of important conversations with Jenna, Pickles and Treb that would not only make Treb want to help PBJ on his way out, but also ensure that Jenna and Pickles would stick to targeting Treb no matter what he said. Pickles gets a CPM this episode for smartly deciding to use her idol to ensure Treb would go home, gaining some favor from the jury but also burning Treb on the way out who sought to weaken her game afterwards as much as possible to the jury. Jenna gets a MOR for mostly deciding to stick with a simple vote and not creating any waves.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108608324808745000 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108608324808745000><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 12:13 AM">12:13 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Pickles</strong> stays at the number one contenders spot this episode as she was able to force the vote to go the way she wanted and ensure that Treb would be ousted. Although that did burn Treb, it was ultimately the smartest move and does give her something to set herself apart from Jenna even further at FTC should they both make it. While Treb does intend to do some damage on the jury, it likely will not be enough to prevent Pickles from snagging the win. 

<strong>Jenna</strong> stays in the number two spot this episode as she, like Pickles, is in a very strong position and is almost locked for FTC, however unlike Pickles she isn’t as visible and doesn’t have as much to her name as far as moves and reputation goes. The two things Jenna does have going for her is her warning Etay to use his idol, and holding her own unused idol which could make for a splashy reveal at FTC. While it does appear that Pickles has the edge between the two of them, Jenna is still very much in the race to win and could overtake Pickles with a strong FTC showing.

<strong>PBJ</strong> rises to the third contenders spot as she actually does have a strong case to make at FTC, one that could definitely beat both Pickles and Jenna if framed well, especially when bolstered by Treb now that he is on the jury. PBJ might even be the front-runner in that FTC, but she has also found herself in a precarious position of needing that F4 immunity otherwise she is very likely going to become the fallen angel of the season.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108608473253543966 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108608473253543966><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 12:14 AM">12:14 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

With the final trust of the season, there is not a ton of value to be seen as pretty much everyone is on an equal playing field. First we still have Treb who has dominated in trust with this game and if he was to make a miracle run to the end of the game this would be a big part of it. Next we have the cluster of Pbj Jenna and Mana who are very close to each other. Pbj is slightly ahead which is a similar story to the entire game so far which they have done very well for themselves socially. Lastly we have Pickles who has fallen a bit but in reality does not mean a whole lot as players are looking elsewhere in who to boot and are only last due to the knowledge of them wanting to vote out the big game players left in the game.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 12:14 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With Treb being ousted at the last tribal, it appeared like the writing was on the wall, or rather plainly stated by Treb in his closing statement - If PBJ won immunity then they would go on to win the game. Jenna and Pickles were confident that PBJ needed to go, but Mana was more conflicted. From a social standpoint, Mana didn’t want to vote out their friend who was so close to reaching one of their goals, but from a strategic standpoint it was the logical decision. 

The final immunity challenge was a gauntlet of mini-challenges, some from previous challenges and some new. Each player made swift progress on four of the five challenges, but most of them struggled with the “Know your juror” section. Mana for a very long time refused to brute force the answer, even recognizing early on it would have been efficient, but rather wanted to see how well she knew her fellow jurors. Unfortunately, she made some misconceptions early about Aura and Annie that set her off on the wrong track for a long time. Jenna and PBJ both took a little over thirty minutes to solve it (though it should be noted that PBJ was thrown off due to a production error that did affect her time). Pickles managed to solve the know your juror section in just a few guesses, giving her an incredibly short time compared to the others. However, after adjusting time to account for the mistakes with PBJ’s scoring, Pickles was still able to prevail, but only by a few seconds (not accounting for the time it would have taken for PBJ to find the answer from where the mistake was made).

With Pickles having immunity it looked like PBJ was backed into a corner with no way out, but Mana and Jenna both were considering going for a seemingly crazy play - giving PBJ fire. From Jenna’s perspective, they thought that compared to Pickles their game may not hold up since Pickles was the more outwardly visible member of the duo, and felt that going to fire against PBJ and winning might give them the leg up they needed at FTC. Jenna also noted that they had never been on the jury before, so should she lose the challenge she’d at least get to experience a new part of the game, further locking her on the decision to try and go against PBJ in fire. Unfortunately for Jenna, her vote had to go to PBJ otherwise there would be no chance at making fire, meaning Mana was actually the deciding factor. 

Mana found themselves at a difficult internal crossroad - Voting based on emotions and relationships or voting based on strategy and game logic. After reaching out to each player to get a sense of where they stood, and with some tears shed along the way, Mana realized that if they wanted a chance to win the game, it meant that they would have to vote out PBJ, even if it broke their heart.

Separate from all of this, PBJ and Pickles were talking about their journey together thus far and things got a bit heated to say the least. The conversation ended with the two of them quite upset at the other, pretty much guaranteeing that should PBJ be voted out, they would not only be leaning Mana, but likely be trying to sway the jury against Pickles. 

Ultimately the vote would end up being 3 to 1 against PBJ, leaving Mana, Jenna and Pickles as the finalists. PBJ and Pickles both get CPNs this episode, with PBJ getting a CP for almost succeeding in getting fire and Pickles succeeding in forcing the PBJ vote when the others were swaying a bit. They both get N tones for their conversations with each other which would leave both very upset, PBJ burned and gassed up to harm Pickles game as much as possible on the jury. Jenna gets a CP for recognizing that while it may cause them to lose, going to fire against PBJ would give their game the bump it may need to win at FTC should it come to that. Mana gets a CPP for their very positive emotional and strategic conversations with each of the remaining players, and for ultimately deciding to send PBJ home.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109281312528928859 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109281312528928859><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 8:47 PM">8:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<em><strong>CONTENDERS:</strong></em>

<strong>Mana</strong> finds themselves at the top of contenders this episode after a very strong final episode which garnered them a lot of favor with PBJ. Mana has a lot of supporters on the jury who were leaning between her or PBJ, and with PBJ out of the picture they are leaning towards Mana for their votes. While Mana doesn’t have many moves on paper, she sought out from day one to play a loyal and honest game and did just that, which seems to be enough to gain the respect of this jury.

<strong>Pickles</strong> is in the second contenders spot this episode, falling as a result of the overwhelming Mana praise in the jury and a particularly negative view from PBJ who is likely to try and undermine their game as much as possible at FTC and on the jury. However, Pickles does have the strongest game of the finalists on paper, and if they have a really strong FTC they may be able to pull it out over Mana.

<strong>Jenna</strong> is unfortunately viewed as a bit too passive to a lot of the jurors, but she does have a few tricks up her sleeve. With an unused idol in her pocket and some quiet but strong moves she made along the way she may be able to convince the jury that her quiet yet strategic game is the one that deserves their vote the most.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109281498332405791 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109281498332405791><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 8:48 PM">8:48 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

In our last edition of Power rankings we have Pbj leading the pack with everyone seeing them as one of the biggest threats and you have to imagine that the players would be doing everything they can to avoid Pbj making FTC if possible. Next we have Pickles who is rated second highest by everyone on the tribe, so if the Jury matches the players perspective and Pbj does end up going home Pickles may be sitting pretty. Next we have both Mana and Jenna who both are seen as the lowest power ranking by some people then the biggest threat to one person, both players are not out of the woods yet and it seems like an FTC can be wide open for everyone.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Cake</strong> has fallen off contenders due to his MASSIVE threat level and perception from the other contestants</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139723728335425648 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139723728335425648><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 8:55 PM">8:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>deep breath</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139723748560355358 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139723748560355358><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 8:55 PM">8:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__embed><a href=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1121923489142677584/1139713870479491132/image.png> <img class=chatlog__embed-generic-image src=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1121923489142677584/1139713870479491132/image.png alt="Embedded image" loading=lazy> </a></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=imgaslightingyou><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=imgaslightingyou src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1062104970935160885.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139723834891698267 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139723834891698267><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 8:55 PM">8:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h1>Episode Eight <img

<h3>Lick-A-Color</h3>
<strong>Cake</strong> and <strong>Icarus</strong> began the cycle with Icarus leaking Aleksi’s idol and Cake calling him a homosexual. They remained allies, with Cake having a villain arc holding this mistake over Icarus’s head. They redeemed their friendship fully when Cake played his idol for Icarus at the tribal council this cycle. The mixture of tones across the episode earn them both OTTMs
<strong>Aleksi</strong> and <strong>Xeb</strong> earn CPs for navigating the vote onto Max and finding good positions for themselves after being in a more rocky spot after the last vote
<strong>Leo</strong> received an MORP for playing his Pet Picture Advantage (:
<strong>Pilot</strong> received an OTTN for his VC freakout with Aleksi and Imagine (and somewhat Paris) freaking out at them to vote for Teddy, and refusing to let them go play Gartic Phone. 
<strong>Max</strong>, despite playing an idol for himself, had to be convinced by Pilot to do so. He receives the N for how the rest of the tribe ostracized him. He’s perceived as a leaker by much of the cast
<strong>Teddy</strong> receives an OTT for his messages to Max about getting voted out, only to get idoled out thanks to Max’s idol play.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139723918568083576 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139723918568083576><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 8:55 PM">8:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<h2>CONTENDERS:</h2><strong>Pilot</strong> jumps to the top spot, not so much for things he has done, but because everyone else is a lot murkier. He has also been a major contributor in most votes, without having many eyes on him. 
<strong>Leo</strong> moves up to #2, mostly due to his reduced threat level
<strong>Icarus</strong> was able to get himself out of a really bad situation (that, to be fair, he got himself into) but has enough game awareness and the perfect threat level to potentially skate by a few votes unharmed.
<strong>Max</strong> falls to 4, with his current perception from the cast painting him in a more negative light, though with an idol played on him, maybe he will wake up. 
Due to this season being a Final 2, there are so many potential paths for everyone left, and there is still a lot of game to play in this volatile season.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139723967276527737 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139723967276527737><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 8:56 PM">8:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> EXTRAY EXTRAY</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h3>Lick-A-Color</h3>
This episode is the one where all hell breaks loose. All the tension building up in the initial stages of the merge comes to a head here. There is lying, fights, and a whole lot of drama.

Starting off simple, we have <strong>Imagine</strong> who was generally not around too much and ended up not contributing a ton to the vote and alliances, getting him a nice UTR.
<strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Leo</strong> are also mostly in the background this episode, getting solid MORs and staying out of trouble. Max was still getting plenty of attention from the rest of the cast, but generally didn’t do too much himself this time around.
<strong>Paris</strong> and <strong>Pilot</strong> get a CP for being major strategic forces within the game. Paris gave some great confessionals about the state of the game, perhaps the most accurate there has been thus far. And Pilot continues to dominate strategically and always puts a lot of thought and intention to the votes.
<strong>Icarus</strong> receives another OTT for causing a lot of chaos that almost always puts himself in danger more than anyone else. The rest of the tribe is not very fond of this and is acknowledging as a key part of many powerful alliances.
<strong>Xeb</strong> also gets a MOR since he was unable to do much to get the vote off of him. Somewhat aware it could be coming, he just couldn’t pull the strings to put it on someone else.
<strong>Cake</strong> and <strong>Aleksi</strong> were very prominent, both earning CPN. They tend to cause a lot of drama and issues between the tribe (and more importantly with each other), and send the vote into a tailspin of craziness and last second panic. They are very strategic and social, but it does not go over very well with most of the cast. Idol paranoia and big personalities are the headlines for these ratings.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1142192329936076850 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1142192329936076850><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 18, 2023 4:24 PM">4:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
<h2>CONTENDERS:</h2><strong>Pilot</strong> stays on top, having great positioning and being in control without many eyes on him. He has yet to really see a target on his back and has been solidly in the majority during the merge. Several paths to the end and could probably beat anyone in FTC due to his solid gameplay and strong social relationships.
<strong>Paris</strong> makes a debut and in second no less! She has lots of ways to get to the end and has a stronger case than most people would think. Good social skills and subtle game moves that have helped her into a strong position.
<strong>Leo</strong> drops to third, mostly because he has really just maintained his position as not a threat and a good person to keep in the game. Could easily make FTC being under the radar but has mostly relied on others to really make moves.
<strong>Imagine</strong> lands the final spot as many people would take him to the end as a potential goat. However, due to the polarizing cast he could get a win over several others simply because he hasn’t really made anyone mad.

This was an episode of all time.
<strong>Cake</strong> and <strong>Leo</strong> Receive OTTNs for their public icing out of Aleksi, refusing to talk to him for any reason
<strong>Imagine</strong>, less involved in the boot, receives the MOR
<strong>Max</strong>, due to his public disagreement with Aleksi in tribal chat, receives the OTTM, due to some folks agreeing with him and some disagreeing
<strong>Pilot</strong> was the main strategic push toward Aleksi (minus Cake, who’s OTT outshone the strategy), and managed to get enough votes toward him
<strong>Paris</strong> Also received as CP, as her ability to not only plan out a possible Plan B with Aleksi, in case Aleksi wanted to idol. Additionally, she RECEIVED Aleksi’s idol before the advantage period ended and Aleksi walked from the game
<strong>Icarus’s</strong> CPM comes from him also being a strategic force this vote while also receiving votes himself. 
Finally, <strong>Aleksi</strong> was very close to playing the idol correctly, though ultimately decided that his goose was cooked anyway and passed his idol along to Paris. Through the two of them, they almost created an opportuity for an idol play</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, August 20, 2023 2:41 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1142890306518393013 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1142890306518393013><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 20, 2023 2:38 PM">2:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<h2>CONTENDERS:</h2><strong>Paris</strong> climbs to the top of contenders for the first time, after souring on <strong>Pilot</strong>’s controlling gameplay style at the last vote. She used her strong social game and low visibility on people’s radars to work many different plans with <strong>Aleksi</strong>, and though those ultimately failed she was able to secretly obtain his idol when he chose not to play it before being voted out this episode. 
<strong>Pilot</strong> slips to the second spot on contenders as he started to alienate his allies and his plans were not as persuasive as <strong>Paris</strong> or <strong>Icarus</strong>’s. The path to final two also begins to look tougher as a strong shield in <strong>Aleksi</strong> leaves the game at this vote. 
<strong>Max</strong> returns to contenders with some visibility as his name was out at this vote, but he was able to work his way through and has a reasonable path to the end as larger threats demand to be taken care of.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1142890631262392390 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1142890631262392390><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 20, 2023 2:39 PM">2:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__embed><a href=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1121923489142677584/1142250353803399258/Screen_Shot_2023-08-18_at_5.14.49_PM.png> <img class=chatlog__embed-generic-image src=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1121923489142677584/1142250353803399258/Screen_Shot_2023-08-18_at_5.14.49_PM.png alt="Embedded image" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1142890748015034491 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1142890748015034491><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 20, 2023 2:39 PM">2:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h1>Episode Eleven <img

<h3>Lick-A-Color</h3>
For the first time all season, a toneless episode! Though there was a lot of moving and shaking, we didn’t feel anyone acted in a particularly positive or negative way 
<strong>Leo</strong> and <strong>Pilot</strong> obtain MORs, mostly for having the least amount of say in the vote
<strong>Paris</strong> gets an OTT for the piss talk (insert OTT pee joke) and for going back and forth on whether she wanted to play her idol 
<strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Icarus</strong> were the main proponents in getting together “<span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#deleted-channel</span>” earning them both CPs. Their push for the other 3 managed to keep this group of 4 together and turn the game in its head from the original power structure Cake had created
<strong>Cake</strong> was the biggest pusher toward the Max vote, and though he failed getting those on his side to vote him out, he still tried to
<strong>Imagine</strong> gets a CP3, because although he did not say much, he was the one who eventually pushed the vote to end up on Cake</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1142890911295082626 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1142890911295082626><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 20, 2023 2:40 PM">2:40 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<h2>CONTENDERS:</h2>
<strong>Paris</strong> remains at the top, as she has an idol on the down low and is connected with most people left in the game
<strong>Max</strong> jumps <strong>Pilot</strong> for the second spot, as although we think Pilot would have a better game at the end, Max is more likely to get there and is generally respected by the current jury.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1142891378225971301 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1142891378225971301><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 20, 2023 2:42 PM">2:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span> Couple new episodes for your viewing pleasure</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Staring with <strong>Icarus</strong> and <strong>Imagine</strong>, both obtain MOR’s for assuming an easy Max boot and not doing much to move
<strong>Leo</strong> gets his MOR from going along with the Imagine vote, though not being the main mover for that. 
<strong>Paris</strong> gets an OTT for generally pushing a lot of her Jokes, a trend that will soon continue…
<strong>Pilot</strong> and <strong>Max</strong> get CPs for doing the most work to decide on Imagine as the boot and bring Leo over to their side to avoid a tie.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1144430582957359174 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1144430582957359174><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 24, 2023 8:38 PM">8:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

<h3>Lick-A-Color</h3><strong>Icarus</strong> tried really hard to flip a vote this cycle, but Paris did not like how much he was trying to push, earning him CPN. Similar sentiments from the rest of the cast being upset with him
<strong>Paris</strong> receives an OTTM, mainly due to her arguments with Icarus. This is compounded with her idol play, which carries a bit of positive, which is how it ended on Mixed. 
<strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Pilot</strong> continue getting CPs, with Max having slightly more visibility due to keeping Icarus thinking there was a chance to save himself</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, August 24, 2023 8:47 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1144432018625679410 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1144432018625679410><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 24, 2023 8:44 PM">8:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

<h3>Lick-A-Color</h3>There was absolutely NO MOVEMENT this episode until the final hour or so
<strong>Leo</strong> obtains his MOR from going along with a relatively clear Max boot, but didn’t push much on his own accord
<strong>Pilot</strong> used his connections with Leo and Paris to make sure Max was getting the vote instead of him. That is until…
<strong>Max</strong> gains a CP for convincing Paris to turn on Pilot, using his threat to really push Paris toward him
<strong>Paris</strong> gains an OTTN for two reasons: turning on Pilot and breaking a promise, and her shenanigans in tribal chat, such as starting a game of fortnite WHILE the firemaking she caused was going on, rubbed many of the Jury the wrong way.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1144433770540314624 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1144433770540314624><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 24, 2023 8:51 PM">8:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<h2>CONTENDERS:</h2>In terms of challenge prowess, <strong>Pilot</strong> is easily the top contender. If he wins the final immunity challenge, he likely wins the game 
We think that <strong>Paris</strong> can still beat Leo in the end if both of them are there, though she hasn’t been the best with challenges. Odds are she would need Leo to take her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Pilot</strong> receives a CPM, his Mixed tone coming from the positivity of winning the final immunity challenge, but also his negative attitude toward Paris and how much he really wanted to vote her out after what happened at F4, on top of his usual paranoia

Allen is at the top of the pack with the best start for this tribe, as he is in a solid duo with Corrupt and both of them have each other at the top of their ranks. Allen also shared advice to Corrupt about an advantage clue. 

Byron places second with a strong trust, putting him in a solid spot for the upcoming tribals, Tails is at third with also decent trust from his tribemates, while Corrupt is fourth just because Thea has him at the bottom.  
On the lower part of the chart there is Dime, who started a 4-member alliance and has trust in the members of the aforementioned alliance but is not reciprocated at all.

Maxor, Ruben and Thea are in a bit of trouble trust wise, but not quite the bottom of the tribe. Ruben could be exempt since Byron already noticed that Maxor and Thea are a duo (and in fact, have each other at top of their trust). 

Dead last is Zen, who meditated too far and when she showed back up, it was too little too late.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:20 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1164429316755554334 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1164429316755554334><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, October 19, 2023 1:06 AM">1:06 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

A very mixed trust over the board. Bella comes on top with no lower than a 3 rank. An comes second with 4 of 8 possible top ranks, this also puts her in a great spot. 

Zach and Gage are next to each other, they didn’t speak over the course of the first day but both went from the bottom of their trust to the upper part after bonding in a hunt. 

Mia, Joseph and Kyle have received more mixed ranks.  

At the bottom of the pack we have Froot and Sierra, both of them had not a solid challenge performance nor a social, had this tribe gone tribal, the boot could’ve been any of these two, if the top players get to agree on who to vote out.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1164429408803762236 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1164429408803762236><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, October 19, 2023 1:06 AM">1:06 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@Edgic Updates</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was the third time this tribe had to attend tribal council and power positions keep being established, as it shows with Allen once again at the top of the trust, having good graces with everybody. After a decent start, Thea has shown a lot of progress, placing second with 2 top trusted allies, basically directing all the votes without any harm.

Byron, Tails and Dime are at the middle of the trust scheme, having decent trust all around the board and just going along with the Corrupt vote. Maxor and Corrupt placed at the bottom, Maxor has just being carried by Thea and their duo is starting to fall apart, while Corrupt’s indecisiveness made him tank and ultimately, ended voted out.

Pecan was attending tribal for the first time and was still having a mixed trust all over the board. Bella kept holding great trust from all the tribe. Gage’s spot improved a lot and made him place second, gaining trust from Joseph and Kyle and overall keeping a solid spot in this tribe. Joseph lands third on this tribe with decent trust overall.

An falls to fourth place, still having three #1 spots but not being trusted by the other half of the tribe could be troublesome down the road. Zach and Kyle land around the middle, with mixed reception from their tribemates. Mia’s lack of activity made her to land at a precarious position, she could’ve been in danger if this tribe went to more than a tribal. Sierra’s activity growing at baby steps but still wasn’t enough to earn trust from their tribemates. Froot once again landed last, with no connections he turned quickly in the easy vote this cycle.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1167982088557969409 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1167982088557969409><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:23 PM">8:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:23 PM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1167982088222412940/image.png?ex=65629015&amp;is=65501b15&amp;hm=463ac178df71c8ea78a1efd777c74a916c0f3a16beafe301d6fad5d3039729b3&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1167982088222412940/image.png?ex=65629015&amp;is=65501b15&amp;hm=463ac178df71c8ea78a1efd777c74a916c0f3a16beafe301d6fad5d3039729b3&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (25.57 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1167982259563929680 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1167982259563929680><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:24 PM">8:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Episode 4:</strong> <em><strong>&quot;I&#39;ll look at a dictionary tonight...</strong></em> - Dime</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1167982414744793139 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1167982414744793139><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:25 PM">8:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

Key Lime ended up being a mix of most of old Pecan + Allen, so is not a surprise that Bella comes out on top of this tribe, holding the previous trust she has got from the old Pecans but also having a solid relationship with Allen. Kyle really shined this cycle, surging from the middle ranks on Pecan to place himself in the power position of the tribe, earning also Allen’s trust as the outsider of this group. 

Gage, Allen and An landed at the middle of the pack for this new tribe. Notoriously the decrease in the activity of An, she went from the top to near the bottom on this tribe solely because of that. Speaking of low activity, Mia and Sierra weren’t the most prominent members on this tribe regarding activity so they haven’t built trust at all with the rest of the members of Key Lime, as they land at the bottom.

Lemon Meringue was comprised of most of old Pumpkin with Joseph and Zach from Pecan. This grouping of players proved to be a bit of a mess when attending the first tribal after the swap. 

Byron and Thea come out on top earning Joseph and Zach’s favor, making a cross-tribe alliance and leading the charge on the vote. Thea especially was more open with the new members and worked with them to land the vote on their desired target. 

Despite being outnumbered, Zach and Joseph were able to infiltrate between the old Pumpkin mechanics and get to survive this important vote, while earning new allies in the process. 

Dime lost a little ground but she will not be a priority to go for this tribe if they do go to tribal as Maxor has been losing some of Thea&#39;s trust slowly over time and his lack of activity almost caused him to be the vote. Dead last was Tails, whose advantage lie caught up to him and he ended up losing Thea’s trust and being blindsided</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:31 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1167984040935170098 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1167984040935170098><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:31 PM">8:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1167984040649953300/image.png?ex=656291e7&amp;is=65501ce7&amp;hm=30aa36ad77c7e20a1ecec9783aab37713fa901f272c03c70758211e82aa3c4ef&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1167984040649953300/image.png?ex=656291e7&amp;is=65501ce7&amp;hm=30aa36ad77c7e20a1ecec9783aab37713fa901f272c03c70758211e82aa3c4ef&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (31.04 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1167984178759999509 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1167984178759999509><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:32 PM">8:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Episode 5:</strong> <em><strong>&quot;I have debts to play, so I&#39;ll become a soldier&quot;</strong></em> - Mia</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1167984526727848106 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1167984526727848106><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 28, 2023 8:33 PM">8:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

One of his closest allies <strong>Kyle</strong> also managed to find the merge idol, but that was also quickly leaked by <strong>Mia</strong> and further dissuaded any action before numbers could be reduced and backup plans solidified, which led to <strong>Sierra</strong> becoming the first member of our jury</li><li><strong>Kyle</strong>, <strong>Allen</strong>, <strong>Thea</strong> and <strong>Joseph</strong> all earned CPs for discovering and cataloguing <strong>Zach</strong>’s advantages in order to develop a safe plan to move forward together. <strong>Zach</strong> received a CP with a Mixed tone for his overwhelming threat level making him a difficult strategy partner to work with at merge</li><li><strong>Mia</strong> received an OTT rating with a Mixed tone for her aggressive gameplay at the start of merge and leaking <strong>Kyle</strong>’s idol at the earliest opportunity, putting her allies in an awkward position</li><li><strong>Maxor</strong> won immunity in the challenge, which turned out to be much needed as his name has come out already at the start of merge.

<strong>Allen</strong> starts the merge with a bang, having the highest trust and being the social star of the game so far, there is not a single soul that doesn’t trust him, and also getting top trust from power players like <strong>Thea and Kyle. Zach</strong> comes second, despite having tons of advantages that could put him at the bottom, he has socially worked his ass, there is no major opposition against him, consolidating his tight duo with Joseph.

Speaking of, <strong>Joseph </strong>ties at third with Thea, he might not be in a power spot currently but is in good graces with everybody, while Thea has been in power since the early game and still carries <strong>Maxor</strong>, while also gets top ranks from <strong>Allen and Byron</strong>, they are in a great spot with a lot of mobility.
After a rough start, <strong>Mia </strong>has picked up the pace at the game, having a strong bond with <strong>Kyle </strong>and an overall good trust. <strong>Bella </strong>lands right at the middle, after a rough series of tribal councils and losing their main allies, she still has some mobility to move forward in the game.

Not doing exactly too good nor too bad, <strong>Byron</strong>, while not in power, could still get a path from his previous allies. <strong>Kyle </strong>landing at bottom 4 is surprising, despite being a power player, not all the rest of the cast trust him a lot, but he has an idol that could be helpful down the road.

<strong>Maxor, Dime and Sierra</strong> land at the bottom, any of them could be picked off one by one with not enough solid presence nor trust, they have to work harder than the rest of the cast to going deep in the game.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, November 10, 2023 12:19 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1172399330678808576 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1172399330678808576><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 9, 2023 11:56 PM">11:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1172399330464903188/ba0635f696a713542fb20e3ac8f2e0ce.png?ex=65602cf6&amp;is=654db7f6&amp;hm=9a57fa4fad15fc9b2145c01b3e90e8d29c99e11c24f3021f8bb9850b6dec2d3d&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1172399330464903188/ba0635f696a713542fb20e3ac8f2e0ce.png?ex=65602cf6&amp;is=654db7f6&amp;hm=9a57fa4fad15fc9b2145c01b3e90e8d29c99e11c24f3021f8bb9850b6dec2d3d&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: ba0635f696a713542fb20e3ac8f2e0ce.png (35.52 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1172399476577677332 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1172399476577677332><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 9, 2023 11:56 PM">11:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Episode 8:</strong> <em><strong>&quot;I&#39;m getting slightly lost in all of my lies&quot;</strong></em> - Joseph</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1172399578662842388 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1172399578662842388><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 9, 2023 11:57 PM">11:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong><ul><li>Coming into this episode the castaways were split into two tribes for a de-merge cycle known respectively as the “<strong>Pot</strong>” and “<strong>Pie</strong>” tribes</li></ul></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1172399857454043168 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1172399857454043168><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 9, 2023 11:58 PM">11:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

<strong>Thea </strong>comes on top for this tribe being the most visible player, whose old Pumpkin connections came to fruit here, as having two #1 ranks from their old tribemates, and still being able to decide the vote with any harm for their game. <strong>Maxor </strong>surprisingly has climbed to the second spot for this tribe, after winning immunity and having a chance to turn into the swing vote, <strong>Thea and Mia</strong> created an alliance with them to lump into the vote and avoid them to be swinged to the other side.

<strong>Bella</strong> slowly recovering ground, makes her to land at the middle, despite not trusting <strong>Thea </strong>at all, she decided to run along the <strong>Dime </strong>vote and avoid it to turn on herself. <strong>Mia and Dime</strong> wind up at the bottom of this split tribe, as <strong>Thea </strong>lost some trust on <strong>Mia </strong>after considering turning on them and <strong>Dime </strong>just for being the target and throw targets without nothing sticking.

Five people, three hidden immunity idols, three extra votes, one immunity. What could go wrong on this tribe? 

Things were settled quickly one the ideal target for everybody didn’t win immunity, it made <strong>Byron </strong>to land at the bottom of this tribe. <strong>Allen </strong>once again shows his powerful social skills, now stealing <strong>Zach’s </strong>#1 ally <strong>Joseph</strong>. Unknowingly for <strong>Joseph</strong>, he lands at second place on trust with 3 HII on this tribe, making him safe from the vote and with enough room to wiggle.

<strong>Kyle and Zach</strong>, despite having idols for their protection, land at the middle of trust but it doesn’t affect the outcome at all, both still have enough advantages to move forward in the upcoming rounds.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, November 10, 2023 10:10 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1172400535094169660 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1172400535094169660><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, November 10, 2023 12:01 AM">12:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1172400534909628517/4da75b8d6c79efb7a33ae1cb9e100353.png?ex=65602e15&amp;is=654db915&amp;hm=5706b3b8498e93de1f68cd5ca929d90785bdebd0e0b496dbae52ff50d607bcaa&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093001603704954920/1172400534909628517/4da75b8d6c79efb7a33ae1cb9e100353.png?ex=65602e15&amp;is=654db915&amp;hm=5706b3b8498e93de1f68cd5ca929d90785bdebd0e0b496dbae52ff50d607bcaa&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 4da75b8d6c79efb7a33ae1cb9e100353.png (50.02 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1172400731601502258 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1172400731601502258><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, November 10, 2023 12:01 AM">12:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Episode 9:</strong> <em><strong>&quot;I&#39;m spinning a thousand plates in the air and at any moment they could all come crashing down&quot;</strong></em> - Allen</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1172400969628262462 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1172400969628262462><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, November 10, 2023 12:02 AM">12:02 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

of <strong>Zach</strong> with a real possibility of going home, but also having allies who would fight for her and allow her to stay</li><li><strong>Thea</strong> gets an OTT and an M tone this episode for realizing that <strong>Zach</strong>’s plan was actually solid but throughout the cycle purposely tried to force a <strong>Zach</strong> vs <strong>Mia</strong> situation and even

play out from here - Either <strong>Allen/Thea</strong> manage to convince <strong>Joseph/Bella</strong> to flip on <strong>Mia</strong>, or they would get picked off back to back (sans a clutch immunity win)</li><li>Coming into the cycle <strong>Allen</strong> and <strong>Thea</strong> both had faith that they could work with <strong>Mia</strong> and <strong>Joseph</strong> and reach the endgame, but it quickly became apparent that any deals that had made prior would not be upheld</li><li><strong>Joseph</strong> once again managed to snag immunity this cycle leaving the door open for a <strong>Mia</strong> blindside if <strong>Allen</strong> and <strong>Thea</strong> play their cards right</li><li><strong>Allen</strong> and <strong>Thea</strong> kicked their attempt at saving themselves off by talking with <strong>Mia</strong> about the possibility of working together this vote and targeting <strong>Bella</strong> in hopes of having a strong and competitive final three</li><li><strong>Mia</strong> quickly shut that idea down saying that it was in her best interest to work with <strong>Joseph</strong> and <strong>Bella</strong> as it’s a final 3 she has a greater shot at winning, but burned <strong>Thea</strong> a bit in the process</li><li><strong>Allen</strong> and <strong>Thea</strong> decided to change course and separately work on getting either <strong>Joseph</strong> or <strong>Bella</strong> to flip to their side, <strong>Allen</strong> primarily focusing on <strong>Joseph</strong> and <strong>Thea</strong> primarily focusing on <strong>Bella</strong></li><li><strong>Allen</strong>’s attempts at convincing <strong>Joseph</strong> he needed to cut <strong>Mia</strong> if he wanted any chance at having equity in the end was met with a very negative reception from <strong>Joseph</strong> and the conversation quickly fell apart leaving <strong>Joseph</strong> and <strong>Allen</strong> both very frustrated with each other and further led <strong>Joseph</strong> to wanting <strong>Allen</strong> out over <strong>Thea</strong> at this vote</li><li><strong>Thea</strong> tried to plead to <strong>Bella</strong> that by voting out <strong>Allen</strong> that she was just setting up <strong>Thea</strong> to go next, and while <strong>Bella</strong> understood her frustrations she tried to explain that it wasn’t so much a move to vote out <strong>Thea</strong> as it was an unfortunate side effect of voting out <strong>Allen</strong> and helping save <strong>Mia</strong></li><li>While <strong>Thea</strong> did give a lot of strong argument points to <strong>Bella</strong> about their current equity and how making a move like this could help give them a shot at winning FTC, <strong>Bella</strong> felt that if their equity was truly that low, that even making a move to take out <strong>Mia</strong> wouldn’t be enough and ultimately if she was going to lose, she’d rather lose to a friend and close ally then betray them and lose anyway</li><li>Although <strong>Thea</strong> and <strong>Allen</strong> both fought hard to try and salvage their position they were unable to get any real traction leading to an <strong>Allen</strong> vote of 4 to 1 with <strong>Thea</strong> ultimately voting out <strong>Allen</strong> as well</li><li>Everyone earns a CP this episode as they all fought hard this episode to either stay in the game or maximize their shot at winning the game with every single one on one blowing up in one way with strategic and social thoughts about the gamestate</li><li><strong>Allen</strong>, <strong>Mia</strong> and <strong>Thea</strong> all earn N tones however as they all were very manipulative and cutthroat in their attempts to save themselves, each burning someone pretty significantly in the process while not actually gaining any favor from any of the other players</li><li>On the flip side, <strong>Joseph</strong> and <strong>Bella</strong> each get M tones this episode for having a lot of mixed reception to their games and plans moving forward. <strong>Joseph</strong> caught a lot of flak for being seen as a follower, but he also managed to snag another immunity and stand his ground and give counter points as to why his game was stronger than people perceived it to be. <strong>Bella</strong> on the other hand recognized that her game may not be as strong as the others, but also recognized that burning her ally with no real shot at changing her equity was a pointless move and only served to hurt her game at the expense of the people she valued in the game</li></ul></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, November 13, 2023 1:57 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div
